<p>The goal of this project is to collect the in-game books of Genshin Impact and make them available
in the EPUB format. Due to the small size of the individual books, they are divided as chapters
and are grouped together by region. The books/chapters of a region are currently unordered and therefore
the reading order might not be meaningful. A few quest-item books have not been included in this
collection, due to very short or (imo.) irrelevant content.</p>
<p>Pandoc (<a href="https://pandoc.org">https://pandoc.org</a>) is used for the export to EPUB. The content of the books
have been taken from the Genshin Impact Wiki (<a href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Books">https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Books</a>).</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: The content of the books are the property of Cognosphere PTE. LTD. and their

<h2 id="volume-1-sal-terrae"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-sal-terrae">Volume 1: Sal Terrae</a></h2>
<p>My shoes are completely waterlogged after trekking here from the banks of Dihua Marsh. The last time I took them off to
pour the water out, a frog jumped out.</p>
<p>From the scale of the ruin, I suspect it is the temple that provided safe refuge for civilians during the Archon War
several millennia ago. I've heard that the God of Salt built such a place. Liyue folklore holds that she was the
gentlest of the gods. In the brutality and chaos of wartime, human beings were puny and disposable. But the Salt God
refused to join the other gods in their senseless battle for dominance, instead choosing to give shelter to those
dispossessed by the war. She brought them here to build a new settlement. She showed them kindness and comfort. And even
as global upheaval ushered in the end of an epoch, she worked tirelessly to bring about a return to peace between the
gods.</p>
<p>It seems that most parts of the ancient city have sunk into the riverbed of Bishui River. It's fortunate that the
foundation of the temple is still here after all this time.</p>
<p>She amassed a group of followers who settled in the area now known as Sal Terrae and lived a humble existence. The city
stood for several centuries, finally falling with the downfall of the god herself.</p>
<p>The gentlest of the gods fell not in battle at the hand of the other gods. She fell at the hand of one of her own
people, the people she had loved so dearly.</p>
<p>He was the first king of the people, and also the last. He had once loved the God of Salt just as the rest did, but as a
mere mortal, he ultimately could not fathom the self-sacrificial love the god embodied. He sought after military might,
in the hope that the city might be able to hold its own in defense and attack. And so, to demonstrate that gentleness
was a virtue unfit for the times, he took a sword and ended the life of the lone, defenseless god. No sooner had she met
her demise than the temple itself collapsed, and the people's city crumbled like salt into the earth.</p>
<p>As for the treacherous king's fate, theories abound but none are certain. Some say he continued to reign in solitude
from the ruins for centuries, finally turning into dust long after the cries of war had subsided, the ruins had been
engulfed by the river, and the insects had hollowed out his scepter. Others say that he took his own life after taking
that of the god, unable to bear the guilt of deicide that weighed upon his conscience. In any case, the people on whom
the Salt God had once looked so fondly became scattered across Liyue. In the safe haven of Liyue Harbor, under the rule
of the Geo Archon, they and their stories survived, and that is why we still hear about them to this day.</p>
<p>Rumors say that the Salt God's body can still be found somewhere in the depths of the ruins. Though her body has turned
to salt, it still maintains her posture from the moment she was struck by the king's sword.</p>
<p>It looks like we're in for some heavy rain: dark clouds are gathering as far as the eye can see. I'd better get moving.
I'm going to head northwest to Mt. Qingce. Hopefully I can make it there before the rain gets too heavy. And hopefully
it's not such a mad dash that I lose my diary en route...</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-qingce-village"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-qingce-village">Volume 2: Qingce Village</a></h2>
<p>Leaving Dragonspine, I waded through rivers, walked across shoals carpeted with silver grass, and made my way through
sun-dappled bamboo forests, before finally arriving at Mt. Qingce. My shoes and clothes were all soaked from the heavy
rain. Luckily, the elders in the village were kind enough to let me hang my clothes in the assembly hall. They even
prepared dry clothes and some food for me.</p>
<p>There were many children in Qingce Village. Sweet as they may be, they can become quite clingy. There were also many
elders here. People living here seemed happy and carefree. The elders said that most of the young people had gone to
work in Liyue Harbor. Many of them already had a family there and they would send money back every month. Having seen
the prosperity and convenience of the city, it's hard for these young people to go back to the rural life here. Liyue
Harbor has brought peace and prosperity to Qingce Village for the time being, but eventually it will also be the cause
of its demise.</p>
<p>Legend has it that the word &quot;Qingce&quot; originated from the name of an ancient monster &quot;Chi.&quot; &quot;Chi,&quot; of course, is what we
call it now in the contemporary language. But in ancient times, the people of Liyue pronounced it as &quot;Qingce.&quot;</p>
<p>An elder said that thousands of years ago, Morax defeated the sea serpent and brought peace back to Liyue. After Chi
died, its body turned to stone, its blood became water, and its scales are now the terraced fields. The monster's nest
became what we now call Mt. Qingce.</p>
<p>But after a quick look, I believe the mountains consist of mostly rocks shattered by impacts from the outside. No traces
of a hydro monster can be found in the rocks. Perhaps the corpse of Chi is long gone and this
monster-turning-into-a-mountain thing is nothing but an ancient tale?</p>
<p>My next destination is the lake located amongst the stone peaks of Jueyun Karst. It is said that there is a labyrinth
where the Adepti live. Let's see if I can find them.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-aocang-lake-jueyun-karst"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-aocang-lake-jueyun-karst">Volume 3: Aocang Lake, Jueyun Karst</a></h2>
<p>I seem to have lost yet another diary... I don't understand, I even made sure to say to myself three times: &quot;Whatever
you do, don't lose your diary.&quot; But then I got caught up in my adventure, and it went straight out of my head. I waste
so much paper every year... I do hope the Dendro Archon won't mind.</p>
<p>I have arrived at a mountain lake located high on Mt. Aocang. To get here, I had to hike up a winding dirt trail, make
my way across perilous wooden walkways built by herb gatherers in ancient times, and then scale a steep, wet cliff. I
was told by some fishermen that the lake is a thousand furlongs deep, but after taking a dip in the water I can safely
say that their statements were pure hyperbole.</p>
<p>The Qingce Village elders were right after all: the mountain lake's water is sweet and warm. This place certainly lives
up to its reputation as a celestial paradise! Back when I had just arrived in Jueyun Karst, an old farmer told me that
the adepti possess a mysterious magical ability that lets them turn into mist and roam in the sea of clouds. I dismissed
it as an old wives' tale at the time, but seeing the way the mist over the lake rises up to the summit and merges with
the sea of clouds, it does make me wonder... The adeptus I've been searching for could be roaming the clouds at the
summit right now, for all I know, and I would be completely oblivious to it.</p>
<p>I headed east down Mt. Aocang and ended up thoroughly lost in a thick forest. Finally, I came to a clearing and
discovered I was back at the banks of the Bishui River. I have an excellent view of the surrounding area here, so I
think this is where I'll camp for the night.</p>
<p>While I was sorting through my things at the camp, I met a young lady who looked like she was out on a treasure hunt.
She was called Eduardo, and she explained that she was heading west to look for a &quot;Miraculous Lake&quot; at the foot of Mt.
Aocang:</p>
<p>&quot;Legends tell of an adeptus who lives besides a lake at the foot of Mt. Aocang on the northern side. If that's true,
then that's sure to be where the adeptus keeps their secret treasure, too... Mwuhahaha, I know exactly what I'll do when
I get my hands on that treasure!&quot;</p>
<p>Then she quickly changed her tune, as if suddenly realizing how she sounded: &quot;I... I'd contact the Guild, and report to
them if I found it! I am a proud member of the Adventurers' Guild, and I have absolutely no connection to the Treasure
Thieves!&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, some adventurers are in the business for material wealth alone. I'm reminded of that classic Liyue saying, &quot;To
each their unfathomable own&quot;... But whatever her motivations, she is a fellow adventurer nonetheless, and a genuine one
at that.</p>
<p>I must say, I was tempted to head west in search of this fabled &quot;Miraculous Lake&quot; myself after hearing Eduardo talk
about it. But in the end I decided to stick with my existing plan. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, I will proceed
to the Guili Plains to see what sights and treasures are waiting to be discovered there. And hopefully I won't lose my
diary again this time – again, barring any unforeseen circumstances. I can't lose another one... May any unforeseen
circumstances be well and truly barred.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-luhua-pool"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-luhua-pool">Volume 4: Luhua Pool</a></h2>
<p>Traveling southeast along the Bishui River, I came across a pond at the foot of Mt. Tianheng on the north side. The
water is clearer than the sky and the water temperature is similar to a human's body temperature. The water has a sweet
aftertaste.</p>
<p>A local herb gatherer told me that thousands of years ago, this pond was once a garden. It is said that during the era
of the Archon War, two lovers, whose families disapproved of their relationship, made this place their rendezvous.
However, the times were merciless, and the man left his lover to follow the Geo Archon. He plunged himself bravely into
the conflict as a mortal among gods... and like so many mortals in those dark days, none heard from him again for
centuries.</p>
<p>The girl wandered the garden, awaiting the return of her lover. The flowers withered and grass grew in their place.
Soaked in a flood, the grass rotted. And when the flood too had subsided, and to dust she had returned, her tears then
converged into this pond. Perhaps it was her deep longing that made the water here so clear and gentle. I spent an
afternoon here and nodded off while taking a bath in the pond. When I woke up, the stars were already glittering in the
night sky.</p>
<p>I noticed a baby fox slinking around me, but it got scared and ran away when I looked up.</p>
<p>Not until later did I realize that one of my shoes was missing and my bag of provisions had been ransacked.</p>
<p>It took longer than I expected to pack my luggage. My next destination is the delta of the Bishui River in the
northeast — Yaoguang Shoal.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-yaoguang-shoal"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-yaoguang-shoal">Volume 5: Yaoguang Shoal</a></h2>
<p>This is the delta of the Bishui River, where the sand and mud carried by the river has accumulated into an open and flat
shoal. When I finally arrived, the shoal was shrouded in a blanket of fog, and my new shoes were soaked again. I heard
the sound of some unknown monsters coming from the fog, but couldn't quite tell their exact location. All that was left
to do was set up the tent and wait for this blasted fog to drift away. When I was staying at the Wangshu Inn, a merchant
told me about the legends of Yaoguang Shoal. He started with a poem — &quot;Jade-lustered waves washed into the ocean while a
conch lay empty on the white shoal.&quot; The meaning of the poem is that the sunlight, pure as jade, glimmers on the surface
of the Bishui River and seems to flow into the sea along with the river water. But the Greenconch Lodge on the Yaoguang
Shoal has been unoccupied for some time. I once ventured into the fog to visit the Seashell Sanctuary, but didn't see
the owner.</p>
<p>A legend among fishermen has it that the Greenconch Lodge was the home of an adeptus — the green conch itself, in fact,
constituting part of her very being. She provided shelter for travelers who were lost in the fog, took care of the
shipwrecked survivors, and bid godspeed to other adepti on crusades against sea monsters.</p>
<p>But older fishermen interpret the legend differently. They say that the Seashell Sanctuary was not the abode of an
adeptus, but of a family that had lived in the giant seashell for generations. They devoted themselves to helping the
lost and saved many fishermen's lives.</p>
<p>It seems the fog is drifting away and the sun is almost visible now. Next up, I'll borrow a boat to get to Guyun Stone
Forest and visit the ruins where the Geo Archon vanquished the sea monster. I should arrive in no time at all if the
weather is good.</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-guyun-stone-forest"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-guyun-stone-forest">Volume 6: Guyun Stone Forest</a></h2>
<p>We skirted past a few small islands occupied by Hilichurls, managing to steer clear of their line of sight, and made it
to Guyun Stone Forest successfully. Six giant Stone Pillars kept the sun out of my eyes as I went ashore, and it was
remarkably cool in their shade. The crabs on the beach were big and meaty. Maybe it's because the area has been
nourished by the remains of a magical beast for millennia? Anyway, they taste great roasted.</p>
<p>The sheer beauty of this place makes it hard to imagine that it was once the site of a bloody battle between the Geo
Archon and the sea monster. Suffice to say that the blood once shed here has long since vanished into the sea without a
trace. I suppose that everything pales into insignificance when faced with the scale of the sea. Whether it's a single
drop of an ordinary person's blood or rivers of blood shed collectively by the heroes of the past, the relentless
flowing of the winds and waves are destined to wash every last trace of it away. In the end, everything will be just as
it has always been, since time immemorial.</p>
<p>Legend has it that the Geo Archon once carved a giant polearm out of the rocky land. He plunged it deep into the ocean,
riding it straight through the body of the demon that wrought chaos upon his domain. Over the years, the wind gradually
eroded the stone polearm into the form we see today.</p>
<p>Later, I'll return to the mainland to camp out for the night. From where I am, I can see the ships leaving the harbor in
the distance. As I write, the Crux is setting sail once more, embarking on its next grand voyage. I wonder what mission
the Qixing Commerce Guild has entrusted to the legendary Captain Beidou this time?</p>
<p>I had the most awful night's sleep last night. I dreamt I was somewhere pitch-black and damp. Suddenly, I was a sea
monster, and my impaled body was being driven into the ocean floor by the Geo Archon's polearm. I writhed around and
clutched at the giant polearm made of rock, trying desperately to free myself, but it was wedged firmly in place. Each
movement I made filled me with agony, and with rage...</p>
<p>Note to self: Guyun Stone Forest is not a good place to spend the night! I woke early, so I lit the campfire and I'll
move out once the sky's bright. My next stop is Liyue Harbor: I just need to be somewhere that I can get my clothes
washed, beard trimmed, that sort of thing. Once I've sorted myself out, I'm making another trip to Jueyun Karst. I
didn't make any progress on finding the adepti last time. This time, I think I'll try my luck at Qingyun Peak.</p>
<p>Another note to self: Do not lose my diary again!</p>
<h2 id="volume-7-qingyun-peak-jueyun-karst"><a class="header" href="#volume-7-qingyun-peak-jueyun-karst">Volume 7: Qingyun Peak, Jueyun Karst</a></h2>
<p>I shall preface my adventurer's diary with a stern reminder to myself. Recently, I keep discovering that I've misplaced
my diary every time I feel like I want to write in it. Oh, Roald, you must learn to be more careful in the future!</p>
<p>After climbing for what feels like an eternity, I have finally reached the top of the precipice. I'm surrounded by a sea
of clouds. It's impossible to know where in the midst of that sea of clouds I once stood looking up at this celestial
place where the adepti dwell.</p>
<p>Apart from the few oddly-shaped trees, there are barely any signs of life here at the top of the precipice.
Occasionally, a Lapis Glede will let out a high-pitched cry before diving down into the clouds and disappearing from
view. Up the hill from here is the adeptus's dwelling, but there's a few things I need to sort out before I head up. The
most pressing issue is repairing my climbing gear. I'll also tend to a few cuts and grazes while I'm at it. A kind
farmer gave me some ointment when I first arrived in Jueyun Karst – it stings, but it really does work.</p>
<p>Nights atop the precipice offer little in the way of comfort. The relentless wind above the clouds pierces to the bone.
It's difficult to shelter oneself from it, because it finds its way to you through all the tiny gaps in the tent, and
there's no way you could keep a campfire alight in this wind. A good night's sleep is therefore out of the question. I
wonder if the adeptus who dwells at the summit ever gets lonely and dispirited being surrounded by nothing but the cold,
heartless wind?</p>
<p>At the end of a long and sleepless night, I finally watched the moon set into the sea of clouds. I'll make sure my pack
is secured fastened, then at daybreak I'll begin my journey to the summit where the adeptus dwells. Hopefully, the
altitude is high enough that it won't rain.</p>
<h2 id="volume-8-qingxu-pool"><a class="header" href="#volume-8-qingxu-pool">Volume 8: Qingxu Pool</a></h2>
<p>To stop me from losing my diary yet again, this time I've put a marker made of moss on the leather case. Now it really
stands out in my backpack. It's perfect! Tonight, I'll put it beside my pillow before I go to sleep — there's no way I
can lose it then. Honestly, I don't think I can keep calling myself an adventurer if I lose my diary one more time... a
misadventurer, perhaps.</p>
<p>I headed westward from the mountain pass at Mt. Tianheng and came to a ruin, known locally as Qingxu Pool. The entrance
of the ruin is located right in the center of a giant rocky outcrop rising up from the center of a shallow pool. It is
surrounded on all sides by steep cliff faces. There are several stone towers which blend in seamlessly with the natural
scenery put here by the Geo Archon. The morning mist is beginning to clear and the first rays of sunlight are starting
to illuminate the mountains and ruins. It looks like it'll be good weather today.</p>
<p>Legends say that these ruins predate the Geo Archon's rule over Liyue. The whole of Lisha was covered by water at the
time of the Archon War, and back then this rocky outcrop was nothing more than a little islet that rose above the
water's surface. After peace was restored, the region of Lisha unfurled once more as the tides withdrew, revealing the
ancient buildings erected by the early peoples.</p>
<p>Back when I was at the Wangshu Inn I met a scholar from Sumeru called Soraya. She had done a fair bit of research on the
ruins in Lisha. Once she got talking about it she could talk all day. What she told me was that these ruins were left
behind by an evil god, whose name has been wiped from the record, and its people. But in the end, the sea gave way to
forests and fields, the self-serving god was defeated, and the strongholds and temples of the ancient city the god's
people once built were left to crumble. That is how Qingxu Pool came to be. The ruins were submerged until the long
Archon War finally came to an end, emerging on the landscape as the tide subsided.</p>
<p>Maybe these crumbling remains have been left as a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era for the adepti and the other
deities. In any case, this is a calm and tranquil place that has, for whatever reason, remained entirely unperturbed by
the relentless development of Liyue Harbor and untouched by the mining operation based at the Chasm. It has just been
left, as-is, right to this day. Perversely, the only disturbances have come since the mining at the Chasm has been
halted, as monsters have now occupied the ruins here. Let's just hope they don't destroy anything.</p>
<p>It is a simple theory, but I need to gather more evidence. I should keep heading north and visit the ruins at Lingju
Pass and Dunyu.</p>
<p>I ran into Eduardo again just before I set off. She seemed to be traveling with a partner this time. She must have been
a busy adventurer's schedule — it seemed like I blinked and then she'd disappeared off into the ruins.</p>
<h2 id="volume-9-dragonspine"><a class="header" href="#volume-9-dragonspine">Volume 9: Dragonspine</a></h2>
<p>I began my ascent of Dragonspine from its southern side, where the mountain meets the riverbanks and plains of Liyue.
The mountain slopes gently here, the wind is soft, and the snow is light. Added to the unfrozen water sources, it makes
this place a good choice for setting up a base camp. Once I have prepared my supplies, I will make a camp here before
continuing my climb to the summit.</p>
<p>After setting up camp, I took the chance to survey the surrounding ruins. What intrigued me is that the architectural
style and artistic patterns are strikingly similar to those seen in ancient buildings elsewhere. This could very well
mean that the fabled mountain civilization of old is right beneath my feet. Unfortunately, I did not find any
well-preserved inscriptions within the ruins, so there was no hard proof of the ancient civilization's historicity.
Perhaps, I will find more information is preserved further up the mountain, buried deep within the bitingly cold
blizzards.</p>
<p>Spending the night here is an unpleasant experience. The cold, damp wind chills to the bone, and the way it shakes the
tent sounds like the roar of a rushing river. Guaranteed nightmare material for once you do manage to fall asleep.
There's a cave by the water, and it must be spacious in there because I can hear the ghostly groaning of the wind
echoing inside. Unfortunately, the entrance is tightly fenced off and there is simply no way to get through from the
outside.</p>
<p>I will start advancing further up the mountain a little later on. There are some remnants of the relatively recent past
by the path, which if I'm not mistaken can be traced back to the era when Mondstadt was ruled by an aristocracy. I dug
up some fragments of clothing and some irreparably damaged weaponry. The dense snow and ice seem to have slowed down the
decomposition process, preserving any pieces of the past that they swallow up for a long time to come. The way that the
items are distributed leads me to believe that a chase once took place here on this mountain path — or possibly even a
murder.</p>
<p>It seems that even fierce blizzards and sinister mutations pose no obstacle to humans intent on following through on
their dark ambitions, In the end, this archon-forsaken snowscape has become stained by mortal transgression.</p>
<p>As I climb further up the path, the wind becomes stronger and the temperature plummets to an unbearably low level, I
scouted out a ruin to the northeast, where to my utter astonishment I found water! It was somehow unfrozen, in defiance
of its perennially blizzard-beaten surroundings. From the location, I would estimate that it is linked to the stream I
saw further downhill. However, this area is so cold that I could not afford to explore deeper inside the ruin for the
risk of freezing to death or drowning. I left a makeshift sign there to mark the spot — I just hope that it doesn't get
buried in the snow. I suppose that once upon a time this could have been an underground shelter and that over the years
the groundwater has seeped in and flooded it. But I have also heard that the tyrants of the distant past were partial to
a form of punishment whereby they would jail a prisoner, lock them in a cage, and then slowly pour water in. Just so
they could force the prisoner to watch in alarm as the water slowly rose up from their ankles to their mouth, nose, and
finally their forehead... Such a cruel and drawn out punishment... And in the sheer cold of this climate, it is all the
more impossible to imagine that any managed to survive it.</p>
<p>Further to the east, the road becomes more rugged. I had a stupid accident and very nearly broke my leg because of it. I
was lucky to only receive a superficial wound and no major bone injury. But it also tore a great big hole in my
windproof clothing, so now I feel the full force of the wind right against my skin. It feels awful, like being stabbed
constantly with a sharp knife. I managed to find shelter from the wind before my wound went completely numb. I just
managed to sew my clothing back up, but there's no way I can continue to the summit like this. I made it back to the
camp, finally, on the verge of freezing to death. As I warmed my feet by the bonfire, I removed my socks to find that
three of my toes had turned purple from the cold... But no matter, right now I'm still enjoying the feeling of coming
back to life after such a close brush with death.</p>
<p>When the storm died down a little, I looked up and caught a view of the peak, towering there silently against the dark
sky, encircled by giant jagged rocks and yet secluded among them in the center. The bards' songs tell of an ancient,
evil dragon who lies buried there in the mountain stream — I wonder if it, too, yearns for the celestial heights even as
it gazes up with its rotting and blinded eyes? Many villagers who live at the foot of the mountain liken this monstrous
mountain to a blind spot in the eyes of the gods, a place ruled by the inscrutable force of fate. Old Mondstadt
fairytales speak of the mountain as a place of punishment that was abandoned by the Wind of Time and left for the
howling winds to sweep in and freeze everything in its moment of destruction. Yet something still stirs here, at the
peak of the mountain. I heard its call in my dream. It was a gentle song, pleasing to the ear, but somehow disturbing to
the mind.</p>
<p>This trip was a disaster, but at least I came out of it alive. Farewell for today, Dragonspine. Perhaps I shall return,
though I do not know if I will ever make it to your summit... I think I will explore Liyue next. But first things first,
my top priority is replenishing my lost supplies. Oh, and while I'm at it, I think I'll swap this soggy old diary for a
nice new one.</p>
<h2 id="volume-10-ritou"><a class="header" href="#volume-10-ritou">Volume 10: Ritou</a></h2>
<p>It's already been a few days since I've arrived in Ritou, and yet the Kanjou Commission still shows no sign of letting
me pass. I don't know how long I'll have to stay... I hope Mr. Kurisu will find a way to get me out of here.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurisu is the local commerce chairman. Originally from Fontaine, he is a reserved and friendly gentleman, possessing
a certain charm that other outlanders makes feel at home.</p>
<p>I'd heard that Inazuma didn't welcome travelers, but it wasn't until I set foot in Ritou that I realized the severity of
the situation. The Sakoku Decree has been in effect for some time. While many travelers have chosen to stay on the
island, many come and go, staying for only a brief period. Many merchants also packed up and went home. Ritou, in its
current state, is a gloomy and depressing place. It is said that hundreds of years ago, Hiroshi of the Hiiragi Clan
built this commercial port. He recruited talented merchants to set up shop here and encouraged free trade. Ritou
flourished and prospered for some time... But poor Hiroshi would probably turn in his grave if he knew of the state that
Ritou is in right now. Still, his descendant, the current Kanjou Commissioner, seems to be living the good life. It's
enough to leave anyone feeling rather resentful.</p>
<p>After a few days, Mr. Kurisu brought me some good news. He's heard that the Crux Fleet will stop by briefly in Inazuma.
There should be a way for this famous armed fleet to smuggle me to another island, he said. I just need to be patient. I
don't know if Mr. Kurisu's information is reliable, but it's always a good idea to be prepared. First, I must think of a
way to get my camp-making and fire-starting tools back from Miss Yurika. I will beg if necessary...</p>
<p>It seems that the Shogunate has attacked another Sangonomiya outpost, inflicting many casualties... or was that the
other way around? The few outlanders who remain have all been gossiping. Even those in service of the Commissioner have
been spreading various rumors without fear. It is unclear what has happened, but still more merchants have packed up and
gone home. Many military ships have come and gone at the harbor, probably carrying emergency military provisions...</p>
<p>Perhaps I can take advantage of the chaos and confusion to retrieve my stuff from the warehouse.</p>
<p>Oh, and I must also remind myself...not to lose this diary again. There are diaries with covers that are more beautiful
and elegant, of course... but that's no excuse for replacing the old with something new!</p>
<h2 id="volume-11-tsurumi-island"><a class="header" href="#volume-11-tsurumi-island">Volume 11: Tsurumi Island</a></h2>
<p>My exploration of Tsurumi Island has not gone smoothly.</p>
<p>Earlier, it was thanks to a local youth named Kama that I was able to leave Ritou successfully and arrive on Tsurumi
Island undetected. At his direction, I tried to penetrate the thick fog that shrouds the island and somehow managed to
catch a hurried glimpse of the ancient civilization present here, as well as certain dream-like landscapes. However,
these memories seem to have dispersed just like a mist might... But I can still clearly remember meeting a small child
on this supposedly long-dead island.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was nothing but a hallucination I saw under the influence of Elemental Particles floating through the fog, or
perhaps the mushrooms on the island were to blame... That child may have just been an illusion or a false memory, and
this would certainly follow common logic, of course. But the second time I came, I brought a little more food with me,
in hopes that the child would accept them. It must be hard living on a dead island like this one, I thought.</p>
<p>The next time I came ashore, I did not inform Kama, and thus got lost in the thick fog very quickly. I tried all means
and ways, but could not find my way through the fog — it was as if it was rejecting me for reasons unknown. If it were
not for the blonde-haired traveler and the little fairy named &quot;Paimon,&quot; I would probably have had to return
empty-handed. But they helped me to pick some local Fluorescent Fungus, which is rumored among Inazumans to have
coalesced from the memories of the ancient dead of Tsurumi Island, which give them their phosphorescent, ghostly glow.
They possess the ability to strengthen the eyes and mind and improve one's memory.</p>
<p>I tried some over the last few days, and these fungi do indeed have the ability to calm the heart and cheer the spirit.
It appears to be good for digestion as well... That said, I haven't seen any marked improvement in my memory yet. I must
remember to leave a few for my friend in Sumeru to conduct research on.</p>
<p>Additionally, I found the pictures of the ancient murals that the blonde traveler and Paimon brought to be most
fascinating — they are certainly worth further research. That we were able to discover such valuable historical ruins at
all is owed to the passion, wisdom, and determination of these two exceptional adventurers.</p>

insects, birds, clouds, patrolling knights, a small companion sent flying by a larger hilichurl. In short, this word
is difficult to explain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Celi&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Hot. Something that is hot. Fire.</li>
<li>Occasionally &quot;sun&quot;; &quot;Celi upa&quot; without &quot;upa&quot; can also mean &quot;sun.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: &quot;Celi lata&quot; is an unusual figure of speech as it implies both cold and heat.
This phrase generally refers to things that emit light but not heat.
For example, &quot;Celi lata gusha&quot; is &quot;Small Lamp Grass,&quot;
And &quot;Celi lata&quot; can describe things such as fireflies, stars, or the moon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Kucha gusha/Unu gusha&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Seed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: It may be hard to believe that I would list such a word. Hilichurls do not specifically practice farming, but they
have a habit of stockpiling seeds. Sometimes when they are in a good mood, they will find a place and bury their seeds.
&quot;Kucha&quot; means &quot;small,&quot; and carries a slightly contemptuous connotation in Hilichurlian. &quot;Unu&quot; is the number &quot;one&quot; and is
a holy word that embodies the hilichurls' concept of gods and the origin of life. Both of these terms can be used to
describe a seed, which is fascinating. By the way, &quot;Du&quot; is two, &quot;Unu du&quot; is three, and &quot;Dudu&quot; is four. Can you guess
what five is? The correct answer is &quot;Mani,&quot; which also means &quot;hands&quot; or &quot;physical labor.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sada&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Solid, hard.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: In Hilichurlian, &quot;Upa sada&quot; means that you are prepared to do something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Boya&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Used with certain words to denote colors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: According to my tests, &quot;Celi boya&quot; is red, &quot;Gusha boya&quot; is green,&quot; &quot;Lata boya&quot; is blue, &quot;Nini boya&quot; is white,
&quot;Nunu boya/Sama boya&quot; are black, and &quot;Unu boya&quot; is yellow.</p>
<p><strong>Time and Directions:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Aba mosi dada&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>From waking until lunch.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unta mosi dada&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The wonderful time from lunch till just before sunset.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mosi aba nunu&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>From after sunset until late night.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unta nunu&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Late night.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Du ya zido dala?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Where did this thing go?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: After some thought, I have decided to omit Hilichurlian directional words from this handbook. Hilichurls do not
have absolute directions, so their directional speech is relative. However, the subject in their responses depends on
their attitude towards you. If they like you, they will speak from your point if view. If not, they will use themselves
as the frame of reference.</p>
<p>The most recommended method is to obtain a map, ask them this question, and have them identify the location on the map.</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-moonlight"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-moonlight">Volume 1: Moonlight</a></h2>
<p>Legend tells of a corner of the city that has been forgotten by the wind. To reach that place one must stand before the
fountain and close their eyes, then wait for thirty-five heartbeats, then walk seven circles clockwise around the
fountain followed by seven further circles anticlockwise. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a
little shop...</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me, is... is anyone there?&quot; Veiga asked timidly as she stepped through the door. As the door closed behind her,
the bell that hung from it rang out, its crisp and clear sound filling the room and cutting through the dimly lit
drudgery. The dull glow of twilight seeped gently through the frosted glass of the display case windows. Stacks of
curious objects filled every part of the room. Veiga made her way through the store cautiously, for fear of stepping on
something and breaking it. There was no answer. Veiga now began to examine the objects around her more closely: an
obscure mechanical component, an ornate ancient lyre, a broken ceramic tile engraved with incomprehensible markings, a
pair of old manacles, dented and scratched from years of use, a forgotten crown that once belonged to an aristocrat...
At some point as she was inspecting these objects of no apparent utility, the shopkeeper appeared beside her. The
shopkeeper's eyes were like those of a fox, with long slender pupils at their center. &quot;That fang once belonged to a wolf
king. Aside from the gods, it is probably the only thing left that remembers that land the way it used to be... every
inch of it covered in ice and snow.&quot; She spoke softly, &quot;Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your
fancy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you have anything here that can help someone... to forget?&quot; &quot;Why, certainly.&quot; Veiga clutched her chest as she
pursued the question further. &quot;... To forget anything? Even... someone very important?&quot; The fox-eyed shopkeeper's
expression turned stern, and she nodded as she continued: &quot;I know that the one you wish to forget is a young man with
limpid eyes as clear as moonlight. He disappeared a long time ago, and left a deep hole in your heart. Nothing else can
fill that hole... all other blessings, no matter how joyful they may be, feel elusive and out of your reach... just like
the moonlight before your eyes.&quot; Veiga was stunned into silence. All she could do was nod along. The fox-eyed shopkeeper
smiled and, seemingly out of nowhere, presented a bottle of wine. &quot;This wine will help you forget your pain.&quot; &quot;Long time
ago in the age when the icy winds blew, our forebears brewed this wine in secret, deep within the frozen earth, to give
them the strength to keep surviving. The method they used to brew this kind of wine was forgotten when the people's fate
took a turn for the better, and their lives became more joyful.&quot; She tilted the wine bottle back and forth. &quot;There is
not much left. And since it seems you have an affinity with this store, this one is for free. Provided, of course, that
this is what you really want...&quot; Veiga took the goblet of wine from the fox-eyes shopkeeper's hand. The goblet must have
once been adorned with a precious gemstone. But it had since been removed, and now the only clue to its existence was
the empty, lonely indentation it had left behind...</p>
<p>When Veiga regained consciousness she was stood in front of the fountain. &quot;Hmm? What am I doing here?&quot; She wondered to
herself. As the moon shone down brightly, she began briskly walking back home. The glow of twilight had all but
disappeared now, and if she didn't get back soon... She had forgotten all about the strange store, from the route that
had taken her there to everything that had happened inside.</p>
<p>&quot;She's gone.&quot; The fox-eyed shopkeeper said, after the door had shut and the bell had stopped ringing. A young man, one
with limpid eyes as bright as moonlight, stepped into view from the back of the store. &quot;Thank you.&quot; &quot;How many times has
she visited now?&quot; &quot;Six... No, seven. Seven times.&quot; The young man hesitated for a moment, and then asked, &quot;Does the wine
really work? It's not that I don't trust you, it's just—&quot; The shopkeeper smiled, though the meaning of her smile was
ambiguous. &quot;This wine causes those who drink it to forget their pain. But your shared history is not a painful thing for
her. All this wine can do is to help her temporarily forget her longing for you, and the grief of losing you...&quot;
&quot;Whenever she sees the moonlight, she will see you reflected in it, and the memories will start coming back... the time
you met at Ludi Harpastum, the afternoon spent beneath the tree at Windrise, the view from Cape Oath, the time you
sneaked out of the midsummer celebrations together, hand in hand, the song and the feathered cape you offered to her at
the assembly of traveling bards... All of these are memories she will be reluctant to part with.&quot; &quot;... I do have another
bottle of wine in my shop, one that can make someone truly forget everything. If you wish... I could give her that
drink, instead?&quot; She smiled slightly as she watched the young man. After a long silence, he let out a sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me — why do you insist on leaving her?&quot; &quot;Ah, well... it's this. This is the reason.&quot; The young man reached into
his breast pocket and took out a spherical object made of crystal. Unknown symbols could be discerned faintly flickering
inside it. &quot;I am led to believe that people who receive one of these will one day disappear from this world.&quot; &quot;If that
is so, then the earlier I leave, the better. She is still young... if she forgets me now, then she will still have
time.&quot; &quot;Well, well, well...&quot; sneered the shopkeeper. &quot;So. You are one of the chosen.&quot; &quot;It would appear so. Do you...
know anything about what happens to the chosen in the end?&quot; The young man asked eagerly. She forced a smile, but did not
reply. &quot;I should be leaving. Now I am the owner of this thing, I suppose I should get on with doing the things that are
expected of me.&quot; &quot;And if she returns? What would you have me do?&quot; &quot;I think... I think we should leave her to handle it
on her own.&quot; &quot;What a heartless man you are.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-glaze"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-glaze">Volume 2: Glaze</a></h2>
<p>Legend tells of a corner of the harbor that has been forgotten by the mountain rocks and the sound of the crashing
waves. To reach that place one must stand in the sea breeze and close their eyes, walk forty-nine steps away from the
clamor of the crowds, then wait till the sound of one's own heartbeat drowns out the voices in the background. Upon
opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop...</p>
<p>&quot;Hello? Anyone in?&quot; Yu'an called out. He tried the door, and let himself in. The bell continued to ring after the door
had closed and as he made his way further inside. The faint sound of crashing waves seeped into the store, like a
distant memory. Piles of seemingly random artifacts were stacked all the way through from where he stood to the other
end of the long and narrow shop. Yu'an looked apprehensively at the range of items throughout the store, somewhat
intimidated by the thought of his silken robes being covered in dust that was potentially even older than he. Old
lanterns made of now-yellowing paper, a giant fang from some unknown monster, brilliant black aerosiderite from the
depths of space, a dull gold-colored geometric object built with a mortise and tenon crafted from an unknown material...
As he picked up a small bottle filled with a fine white crystalline powder, he heard a soft voice coming from someone
who was now stood next to him. &quot;This is salt formed from the residue of an ancient archon's tears—&quot; The voice caught him
off guard, breaking the long silence like a stone disrupts the surface of a pool of still water. Startled, he dropped
the bottle he held in his hand. But the sound of smashing glass his ears were anticipating never came. The shopkeeper,
who had fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils, had somehow caught the bottle and returned it to its place on the
shelf.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm, er... Huh, I can't remember who it was, but... someone recommended this place to me.&quot; She gave a slight nod that
acknowledged she had heard him, but was ambiguous as to what she thought about it. &quot;Welcome to the store. Do you see
anything that takes your fancy?&quot; &quot;I'm looking for a gift for... she's a girl I like.&quot; &quot;I've been thinking of proposing
to her, and I'd like to have a gift to go with it.&quot; Yu'an nervously bit his lower lip as he looked up to face the
shopkeeper directly. She had mysterious golden eyes that reminded him of Cor Lapis. They looked at each other for a long
time in silence. Finally, she spoke: &quot;Very well.&quot;</p>
<p>Her slender figure disappeared back into the depths of the store. When she returned, she held in her hand an object that
gave off a faint iridescent glow. On closer inspection, it revealed to be an exquisitely cut ten-sided illuminating
crystal. &quot;I trust you will have heard the legend of the crystal heart?&quot; He hadn't. But he nodded anyway. &quot;It is made
from a variety of crystal called illuminating crystal. Man-made versions exist, but they are pale imitations. True
illuminating crystal is capable of revealing the secrets of one's heart, for it is formed from the unfulfilled desire
and grief of illuminated beasts of the highest order when they reach the end of their life. Please, take a look...&quot; She
gestured to Yu'an that they should both watch the faintly flashing images emerging from within the crystal. Tens of
thousands of years flashed by before his eyes. Like the continuous shifting of the clouds, stars turned to water and
water turned to land. Snow melted and gave way to green pastures. Rivers cut their way through the open country. He
watched cities rise like ants' nests and kingdoms topple like toy building blocks...</p>
<p>...The twilight grew dim. Moonlight zigzagged its way across the uneven surface of the ocean. When Yu'an regained
consciousness, he found himself walking by the docks. The crystal he held tightly in his hand had become warm, as if
blood pulsed through it. &quot;This is a wondrous crystal heart indeed,&quot; he thought to himself, increasing his pace as he
walked on under the moonlight. &quot;All I need to do is give this to her... Once that's done, then I can... I must...&quot;</p>
<p>The bell that hung from the door rang out, crisp and clear. &quot;Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your
fancy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to exchange this — well, I don't know if it counts as a gemstone, or...&quot; The finely cut crystal sparkled
brightly, scattering rays of light throughout the room. &quot;It was given to me by a man who's been pursuing me. He said
that if we looked into it together, we would see many marvelous things.&quot; &quot;But somehow I just find it makes me feel
uncomfortable. It's a beautiful gem, of course, I just... each time I think of him, I get so exasperated. So I wondered
if this store would be willing to take it off my hands.&quot; &quot;I understand. But this is a highly prized ten-sided
illuminating crystal. For what quantity of Mora would you be willing to part with it?&quot; &quot;Actually, I do not want for
money. But let me see... what's this — it looks like salt? It's about time I went to Sal Terrae to pay my respects
again. If it's okay with you, this is all I need in return for the gem.&quot;</p>
<p>The fox-eyed shopkeeper sat alone at the back of the shop, turning the geometrically flawless crystal in her hand. &quot;In
you, I have seen unpleasant things. That fellow's true nature, it is unbelievable... it is upsetting.&quot; &quot;That said, when
it comes down to it he is but a lowlife opportunist who wishes to marry into a wealthy and prestigious family in the
salt industry, and will do whatever is necessary to achieve his wish. Had this not come to light, it is entirely
possible that they may still have enjoyed a happy life together, despite it not being born out of genuine mutual
affection. After all, happiness is but a state of mind - it is not related to love.&quot; She took a dainty sip of wine, and
smiled mockingly at the thought of her own vanity. &quot;But the fact is, I simply have zero tolerance for people like that.&quot;
&quot;On the other hand, it is delightfully straightforward opening up to a complete stranger. I know that once he sets foot
outside that door, we never have to meet one another again - so what does it matter if I reveal a little truth to him?
Perversely, the closer two people become, the more one seeks to gain, and so you must be on your guard. But how could he
have known...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, this has all been quite the imposition on you. But it is truly wonderful to have this back.&quot; She lowered her
gaze and continued, &quot;This is, after all, your heart that you have left behind. I will be sure to treasure it... But
don't you think it's fun? Taking a trip down into the world once in a while, seeing what people are like nowadays?&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-sapphire"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-sapphire">Volume 3: Sapphire</a></h2>
<p>Legend tells of a corner of the city that has been forgotten by the wind. To reach that place one must stand in the
center of the plaza and close their eyes, walk seven circles clockwise around the plaza followed by seven anticlockwise
circles, take forty paces forward and then wait till the cries of the birds can no longer be heards in the wind. Upon
opening one's eyes, one will find they have arrived at a little shop...</p>
<p>The shopkeeper, who had fox-like eyes with slender lines for pupils, opened the glass double doors to let in the bright
moonlight, which seemed to sweep up the stardust from across the night sky and sprinkle it down upon the counter.
Everything, from the ostentatious flowers, the dust-covered harpastum, and the old books rendered illegible by years of
erosion, to the now-stringless old longbow, appeared as the opulent halls of the ruling aristocrats might have done in
times of old — covered in a shiny silver coating, though this was a silver that came from the cold light of the night
sky.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey. Business any good these days?&quot; This audacious alternative to the courteous greeting most people would opt for in
the circumstances came from somewhere deep in the back of the shop. The shopkeeper turned around. A familiar customer
was sat nonchalantly on her armchair in the part of the shop that the moonlight did not reach.</p>
<p>&quot;Business is fine. But these days, it would appear, I need to watch out for burglars.&quot; The shopkeeper responded with a
slight smile. &quot;That's it? You're going to turn away your oldest customer, just like that?&quot; The customer let out a sigh,
&quot;There's nothing in your shop that's worth me spending money on anyway. I mean, if I really had to pick something...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well? How was the... hunt?&quot; &quot;What do you mean? You think I'm just here to offload some loot again?&quot; The &quot;hunter&quot; let
out a displeased grunt at the shopkeeper's insinuation. But the shopkeeper continued to smile. &quot;Why, of course not. When
have I ever heard you use the word &quot;loot&quot; before?&quot; &quot;On the contrary... all the &quot;exchanged goods,&quot; &quot;free gifts,&quot;
&quot;philanthropic donations,&quot; &quot;bestowals&quot; and so on that you have so generously given over the years... why, they must make
you the most charitably inclined burglar to roam the streets, no?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that's not why I'm here this time. This time I am here to ask for something from you... the wine. That special
wine you've got that helps you forget about the one you long for.&quot; Though a burglar by trade, this customer was
nevertheless valiant at heart. His words lacked courtesy, but the smile on his face was entirely earnest.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm terribly sorry. Somebody has already bought it.&quot; He looked, and somehow, she was now holding in her hand the wine
flask that he had discreetly slipped into his breast pocket earlier. &quot;Each item in this store is spoken for. This
particular one has already been bought by a customer who will turn up at some point in the future.&quot; &quot;It seems your
sleight of hand is superior to my own. What a disgrace I am...&quot; The burglar of valor said with a pained smile. &quot;I
discovered recently that the feeling of longing for someone is heavier to carry than gold. In my line of work I am
forever leaping between rooftops and running along rafters. I need to cut out whatever... unnecessary weight I can.&quot;
&quot;...I wonder if the girl with the sapphire-blue eyes feels the same weight that I feel?&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the shopkeeper was startled by the jingle of the door bell. The customer who had just arrived was a blue-eyed
sorceress with a Pole in her hand and a tall, slender figure to match. The marks on her face bore witness to her
persecution by the aristocrats. Ignoring the piles of random objects strewn around the store, she marched straight to
the counter like a sword lunging toward its opponent's heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?&quot; &quot;I have an item I wish to exchange.&quot; her tone sounded
cold but fragile, like thin ice in the moment that it shatters. As the sorceress spoke, she placed a giant blue crystal
onto the counter. &quot;A burglar pried this from an aristocrat's silver goblet. He gave it to me as a gift, and then I was
punished by my master for it.&quot; &quot;But that was many years ago. I had thought that with the passage of time my anger would
be quenched and my desire to see him again would fade away...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well. What sum of Mora do you ask for in return?&quot; The sorceress gestured toward the tableware cabinet, in which
stood an aristocrat's silver goblet with its gemstone missing. The fox-eyed shopkeeper turned the crystal in her hand,
flooding the room with the brilliant blue light that reflected off its surface. &quot;I see. Well, provided that this is what
you really want...&quot;</p>
<p>When a person encounters a setback, the worry that everything shall come to a fruitless conclusion appears. The advent
of fear causes cracks to appear in the mind. Death follows easily in the footsteps of fear, like a damp cold that, to
the unprepared, pierces to the bone. For many, it is only in the moment that death is upon them that it dawns on them
that their weakness has now been targets with fatal consequences — and that at some point, therefore, that weakness must
have been exposed.</p>
<p>Lifting the blue crystal up into the moonlight, the shopkeeper gazed at it intently with her fox-like eyes with slender
lines for pupils. She watched with delight as the crest of the ruling family came into view, faded out, and came back
into view once more. Legends claim that peering into a pure gemstone at a specific time can reveal the past, the future,
and even someone's true nature. Just as legends claim that somewhere in the world, there is a field of dandelions as
vast as the sea. Or that once there were three bright moons in the night sky named Aria, Sonnet and Canon, sisters who
were parted by death in a great catastrophe. Or that there was once a witch who could see death before it took place,
but in the end herself died from the broken heart, as he who had stolen it from her waited in distant lands longing to
see her again. One thing she knew for certain was that even if she were to abandon these objects, the legends attached
to them would not disappear, and the way the stories ended could not be undone. In which case, it seemed to make sense
to collect all the legends and stories she could in her shop.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-heart-of-stone"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-heart-of-stone">Volume 4: Heart of Stone</a></h2>
<p>Legend tells of a corner of the harbor that has been forgotten by the mountain rocks and the sound of the crashing
waves. To reach that place one must stand in the sea breeze and close their eyes, walk forty-nine steps away from the
clamor of the city streets, then wait until complete silence replaces the sounds of the voices in the background, the
only remaining sound being that of one's own heartbeat. Upon opening one's eyes, one will find they arrived at a little
shop...</p>
<p>&quot;Is anybody in?&quot; The man tapped on the front door as he called out. He was draped in a raincoat. He peered in through
the dusty windows at the objects on display around the store — a bottle of glimmering stardust, a broken blade that
gleamed like ice, a painting on a roll of paper that the years had turned yellow, an elixir that gave off a mysterious
aurora, a tile thinly coated with gel-like substance... He entered the store. The door closed behind him. He walked over
to the counter and began inspecting the weird and wonderful objects in the store. All seemed to be relics of a bygone
era. Then, a soft female voice came from beside him. &quot;Welcome to the store. Do you see anything that takes your fancy?&quot;</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, he turned to face the speaker, a fox-eyed shopkeeper, who let out a faint smile. &quot;Here's the thing...
I'm looking for a certain something that can help me settle and old score.&quot; The man spoke with a voice that was clear
and resonant, but that had a hint of apprehensiveness about it — one which did not seem to fit with his physical
appearance. &quot;Oh? Very well then.&quot; The shopkeeper's golden fox-like eyes flickered as she examined this new customer of
hers who was draped in a soaking-wet raincoat. She gave a nod. She leaned down to search in the bottom of the cabinet.
When she stood up a moment later, she was holding a large and beautiful piece of Cor Lapis.</p>
<p>The Cor Lapis in the shopkeeper's hand gently glowed a dark shade of gold, much in the same way that her eyes did. The
man took the stone from her hand and studied it closely in the moonlight. In this light, the Cor Lapis seemed to reveal
a deep turbulence concealed within its soft golden hue. His hands were still trembling.</p>
<p>&quot;Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks. Even the hardest and most resilient of rocks will, over time, eventually produce a
pure, limpid sould.&quot; The shopkeeper's voice seemed to be coming from a distant place. The man gave a nod. &quot;This is
precisely what I was looking for.&quot; The man solemnly responded, and placed a heavy sack of Mora upon the counter. Then,
he left the store and ventured off into the midnight rain.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what happened.&quot; After the shopkeeper had spoken, she narrowed her fox-like eyes and examined the customer in
front of her. &quot;Did he say nothing else at all? Judging by his appearance, the young man was presumably a miner. His eyes
betrayed an urgency that he could not contain. But the shopkeeper responded simply by calmly shaking her head. &quot;He left
a sack of Mora with blood stains on the outside.&quot; Like a pool of water, the shopkeeper's voice was calm and still, but
also icy cold.</p>
<p>&quot;That is precisely what I was looking for.&quot; The young man let out a long sigh. It seemed he wanted to evade the golden
gaze of the fox-eyed shopkeeper. &quot;In return, I will give you a story.&quot; The shopkeeper nodded her head to indicate that
he should continue. &quot;That man in the raincoat... I used to go mining with him, up in the mountains. I wanted to make a
name for myself. He just wanted to support his family...&quot; &quot;One rainy night we broke open a rock to find that substantial
piece of Cor Lapis inside. The pure golden glow that radiated from its surface was a more breathtaking sight to behold
than all the marvels of Jueyun Karst put together...&quot; &quot;We agreed that we would split it fifty-fifty once we got back to
Liyue Harbor. But that night, under cover of the deafening roar of the torrential rain... I discreetly made it so that
that clifftop would be his final resting place...&quot; &quot;I did it because I was scared I couldn't trust him... I couldn't
trust in a promise that, aside from ourselves, only the adepti could have heard — and they're probably imaginary
anyway.&quot; &quot;So... Fear won me over. I could bring myself to accept that the whole sum could be mine if I was willing to
get blood on my hands, but I couldn't bring myself to accept the risk of traveling with a stranger...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The following morning, I let down my rope and began my descent down the cliff. I had taken maybe four steps, five or
six perhaps, and I was adjusting my footing on a rock when suddenly, I felt the rope trembling in the palms of my
hands... Instantly that same trembling permeated every fiber of my being...&quot; &quot;I lifted my head to look at the rope, but
it was too late...&quot; &quot;The last thing I remember seeing was the rope fibers at the end of the snapped rope.&quot; &quot;Only a
hunting knife could have made a clean cut like that. I am sure of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, in the end, you two settled your score.&quot; The fox-eyed shopkeeper smiled so faintly it was all but indiscernible.
&quot;He takes the Cor Lapis, and you take the whole sum of money for it.&quot; The young man did not say much in reply.</p>
<p>Legends claim that Cor Lapis is the soul of the rocks of the earth, and that the stronger the life force of the rock the
more power it possesses to reveal a person's true nature. Some say that even after its owner has left the world, Cor
Lapis will bring their unfulfilled desire and regret back into it, waiting for one with the ability to fulfill them. So
the legends claim. It had now been around four hours since the two strange customers had left the store. The rain
continued to pour down. The shopkeeper stood by the window for a long time, peering out at the dark street engulfed in
misty rain. &quot;But... Is the score truly settled? Are are they now truly free?&quot; She spoke as if posing her question to the
curtain of rain, but knowing that the answer would never come.</p>

<p>Quite possibly a battle song sung by the hilichurls before combat. I have observed that when two or more hilichurls are
present, they engage in frenzied brawling after singing this vulgar song.</p>
<p>The second song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eleka mimi-a-Domu<br />
Mita domu-a-dada<br />
La-la-la<br />
La-la-la<br />
Mimi mosi ye mita</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The song is sung by hilichurls as they dance around totem poles.
In my estimation it is some form of tribal hymn. It has an upbeat tone and is usually heard during festivals.</p>
<p>The third song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mi muhe mita nye<br />
Mi muhe mita nye<br />
Muhe nye<br />
Muhe nye<br />
Gusha<br />
Biat, gusha</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A melancholic hilichurl song I heard during an exchange with an elderly samachurl. Although I do not yet understand the
literal meaning of the poem, the overwhelming sense of grief that comes through in the song is enough to captivate the
best poets in my birthplace (despite such praise, I must admit the acrid smells coming from the elderly hilichurls were
just as melancholic, and just as overwhelming).</p>
<h2 id="volume-2"><a class="header" href="#volume-2">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>The fourth song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Celi upa celi<br />
Sada shato lata<br />
Kuzi unu ya zido<br />
Unu dada</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A song sung by Samachurls. Judging by the reaction of the chief, the song seems to bear a special philosophical meaning
for the hilichurls. It may appear ridiculous in the mainstream academic circles, and I have no intention of casting
doubt upon well-established views, but I feel obliged to say that the question of whether philosophical discourse truly
exists among the Hilichurls is one that still fascinates me to this day, and may be deserving of further study.</p>
<p>The fifth song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nini movo muhe yoyo<br />
Nini movo mimi tomo<br />
Lata movo mosi yoyo<br />
Celi movo celi yoyo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much like the people of Mondstadt, the wind-worshiping hilichurl tribes often drink to excess and sing endless songs of
praise to the Anemo Archon. This is a hilichurl ode that is often heard when they are inebriated.</p>
<p>The sixth song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unu, unu<br />
Yaya ika kundala!<br />
Unu, unu<br />
Mita dada ya dala?<br />
Unu, unu<br />
Kuzi mita dada ye<br />
Mita dada-a-mimi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pious ode that is only sung by hilichurls during sacrifices. When performing this ode, the hilichurls often add
percussion by beating the backsides of the weakest tribe members with planks, creating rhythmic ringing sounds. It must
be quite painful.</p>
<p>The seventh song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mimi movo<br />
Mimi sada<br />
Mimi domu<br />
Domu upa<br />
Gusha dada</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that many hilichurl tribes share a tradition of exchanging songs around bonfires in the moonlight. This song
is one such bonfire ballad sung by the chief at the end of the night. At the end of the song, the chief shouts &quot;nunu&quot;
three times, which presumably carries the meaning of &quot;sleep.&quot;</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hilichurl-cultural-customs"><a class="header" href="#hilichurl-cultural-customs">Hilichurl Cultural Customs</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-1">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p><strong>Hilichurlian Social Structure</strong></p>
<p>The social structure of the hilichurl race is evidently a primitive, tribal one. Small-sized hilichurl tribes are
prolific in occurrence throughout the wilderness. It seems that they conceive of the tribe as akin to a large, extended
family.</p>
<p>By far the most powerful figure in the hilichurl tribe is the Shaman. Extensive field research confirms that the Shaman
is the oldest member of the tribe and plays a role in it analogous to that of the parent in the family: managing major
affairs and making policy decisions, based on their wealth of experience. Additionally, Shamans act as protector to
their tribe using their elemental abilities. Shamans can be identified by their distinctive appearance from other tribe
members: They wear horned, smiling-face masks with eye holes at the mouth, and wield a rudimentary Shaman's staff in
their hands. A further identifying feature is that they will be heard chanting to themselves some form of unintelligible
hymn or incantation.</p>
<p>Age is not always the deciding factor when it comes to status in the tribe. In some tribes, Shamans are ousted from
leadership by physically larger Hilichurls with superior combat skills. Under leadership of this kind, such tribes tend
to become more aggressive. The chiefs of these tribes can easily be identified from their large stature and ostentatious
masks, which also bear horns.</p>
<p>The hilichurls' hostility towards outsiders, coupled with the obvious language barriers, means that conducting specific
research on the distribution of resources within tribes has been all but impossible. Nevertheless, Knights of Favonius'
patrol reports suggest that resources are typically shared on the basis of &quot;to each according to his needs&quot;. All tribe
members are both gatherers and soldiers, but some that prize combat above others develop into seasoned heavyweights of
the battlefield. If the tribe stays long enough in an unfavorable environment, these heavyweights will become its most
respected leaders.</p>
<p>Interestingly, hilichurls seem to have a unique ability to manipulate the elements despite their low intelligence and
primitive social structure. The ability is most notably manifested in the Shamans. Typically, humans require a Vision in
order to exercise elemental control. The question of how Hilichurls are able to do so without a Vision is, therefore,
one that requires further investigation and analysis.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-1">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p><strong>Hilichurl Spirituality</strong></p>
<p>Just as the inhabitants of the Seven Nations of Teyvat each have their religious beliefs, so too do the hilichurls.
However, they worship not a specific figurehead with a presence in this world — such as one of The Seven — but elemental
power itself in a more abstract sense. For instance, some hilichurl tribes in Mondstadt revere Anemo just as their human
counterparts do, but they do not recognize the Anemo Archon Barbatos. Instead, they worship the power of Anemo itself.
Hilichurls holding different elemental beliefs often live together in the same tribe. An individual hilichurl's
elemental affiliation can be deduced from the designs on their masks and the color of their body paint.</p>
<p>Firsthand observations indicate that the Shaman, responsible for organizing offerings and worship ceremonies for the
tribe, applies a colored dye to their hair and skin, with the color representing the element they worship. Shamans are
dressed and adorned more ornately than ordinary tribe members, but owing to the limited intelligence of the hilichurls
it is highly doubtful that any of the fine ornaments worn are crafted by their own hand.</p>
<p>The Shaman is the spiritual leader of his tribe. He leads them in song and dance during worship, singing hymns of praise
to the elements. If there is leftover meat from the hunt, the hilichurls place it on the altar, raw, as sacrifice. Even
though they accumulate ample Mora, precious stones, and other items of value through exploring, looting, mugging, and
other means, it would appear that raw meat alone is considered a sufficient sacrifice.</p>
<p>It would appear that the hilichurl possess no concept of either the past or future, living only in the present. They do
not intentionally store up food for survival, nor do they commemorate their deceased forebears. Though crude attempts at
something like calligraphy have been widely observed within their camps, closer inspection reveals these markings to be
nothing more than botched imitations of what they have seen in ancient ruins, possessing no originality whatsoever.
Hilichurls do seem to have an inexplicable affinity for remnants of the past, evidenced by the fact that ruins are one
of their preferred locations to camp. But investigations thus far have turned up nothing which might hint at the true
nature of their connection with the lost civilizations to which these ruins belong.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3"><a class="header" href="#volume-3">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p><strong>The Mysterious Loners</strong></p>
<p>Among the Hilichurls exists a kind of mysterious, large creature possessing both immense physical strength and the
ability to control the elements. They use this elemental ability to further enhance their physical state, such as to
protect themselves or increase the brute force of their attacks — a combination making them nearly unstoppable.</p>
<p>These powerful Hilichurls are called &quot;Lawa&quot; by the rest of the tribe, a respectful form of address best translated to
mean &quot;king&quot; or &quot;chief&quot;. However, Lawa don't actually rule over or lead the tribe at all. Rather, these large loners
prefer solitude, avoiding the looks of reverence from the smaller Hilichurls.</p>
<p>Adventurers very rarely encounter these gigantic creatures. Still, even the most seasoned adventurers will think twice
before going on expeditions into areas where these dangerous Lawas may be roaming.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4"><a class="header" href="#volume-4">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p><strong>Dadaupa Gorge, Mondstadt: a Case for Cultural Diversity Among the Hilichurls</strong></p>
<p>The Meaty tribe is fond of feasting. They have built a boar-rearing pen in the center of their settlement and assigned a
swineherd to watch over it. Over a natural stove made with a Pyro Slime, they cook boar stew in a single, large pot from
which each tribe member feeds according to their needs.</p>
<p>The most striking feature of this tribe is its sizable combat arena. Those who set foot in the arena are understood to
be accepting an open invitation to engage in combat, and those subsequently ousted from it face being mocked by the
entire tribe.</p>
<p>The Sleeper tribe is prone to sleeping at every opportunity. They have built themselves an environment especially
conducive to sleep, consisting of simple, wooden huts furnished with soft animal hide for beds. They are the most
cunning and devious of the hilichurl tribes, and their above-average mental capacity can perhaps be attributed to the
superior sleep quality they enjoy.</p>
<p>The practices of the Eclipse tribe are the most occult of any in Mondstadt. They concern themselves neither with brains
nor brawn, but with occult power. Distinct from the elemental powers worshipped by their peers, the object of their
worship is a crude symbol that appears to represent an eclipsed sun. Their shamans are more powerful than those of the
other tribes. In the center of their settlement, the other tribe members have built a grand throne for the most
formidable of shamans who leads them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="teyvat-travel-guide"><a class="header" href="#teyvat-travel-guide">Teyvat Travel Guide</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-mondstadt"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-mondstadt">Volume 1: Mondstadt</a></h2>
<p><strong>Dadaupa Gorge</strong></p>
<p>The three hilichurl tribes Meaty tribe, the Sleeper tribe, and the Eclipse tribe located in this valley are all densely
populated. What if we built a huge spinning ball-shaped cell in the center of the valley and threw all of the hilichurls
into it? That way we might be able to generate enough energy to power all the mills in Mondstadt for at least five
years. If we took it one step further by grinding the hilichurls that are too old or too weak into food and feeding them
to the strong ones, we might just build ourselves a perpetual motion machine that can support a huge factory like in
Snezhnaya! It seems totally feasible to me. But when I told Miss Lisa about this idea, she just looked at me and
pondered in silence for a long time, then changed the subject gracefully.</p>
<p><strong>Starsnatch Cliff</strong></p>
<p>The Anemo Archon is a bit too undisciplined for me. If I were a god, I would not have allowed my realm to look so
unorganized and ragged. With enough bombs placed in proper positions, even huge cliffs like Starsnatch would crumble
into dust in a second. With flatter terrain, Mondstadt would surely look much nicer. But that unctuous Cavalry Captain
rejected my proposal instantly. He even asked me to stay away from Starsnatch Cliff.</p>
<p><strong>Windrise</strong></p>
<p>At the center there is a huge oak tree. It is said that Vennessa ascended there. I searched around the tree for a long
time but did not find any launching device. I grabbed some hilichurls nearby to put my theory to the test. Sadly, the
longest flying distance was from here to the hunters' huts around Springvale. How disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>Falcon Coast</strong></p>
<p>My unsuccessful experiment caused quite a stir in Springvale, so Miss Jean from the Knights of Favonius arranged someone
to keep tabs on me. All I could do all day was to wander around at Falcon Coast. This is such a boring place. Those
stupid eagles hovering in the sky and puffed-up Anemo Slimes all bored me to death! The worst of all was that I had
nothing to do! On the other hand, the Outrider girl who was sent to monitor me had quite a lot of fun with the kids.</p>
<p><strong>Whispering Woods</strong></p>
<p>Yet another forest in Mondstadt. This Outrider named Amber seemed to know her way around this place. The explosive toy
she carried around caught my attention. With some tweaks, I could turn it into something that could blow this forest and
even the nearby mountains into smithereens easily. My proposal seemed to scare her. But an explosive stuffed toy is
indeed a brilliant idea. I must try it out next time.</p>
<p><strong>Brightcrown Canyon</strong></p>
<p>I finally got rid of that stalker from the Knights of Favonius. This valley I found at the northeast coast of Cider Lake
is still guarded by ancient mechanisms, but the soldiers responsible for holding the pass for the King of Gales were
nowhere to be found now. All the winds of time had left behind were the unintelligent hilichurls and silent mechanical
guards. My attempt to control Ruin Guards with hilichurls failed as well. The guard split into pieces, and as for the
fate of the hilichurl strapped onto it... I will spare you the gory details. Half of the ruins were also destroyed in
the process.</p>
<p><strong>Stormterror's Lair</strong></p>
<p>Brightcrown Canyon leads to this huge ruin of an ancient city which was built by the cruel King of Gales, Decarabian.
The city was built in a ring-shape. It seems that every resident of the city had been arranged their own spot between
the inner and outer rings. Right in the center of the city was the tall tower where the King of Gales resided. The ruins
of the domain of this cruel king, who once tried to control his people's lives, are now utterly deserted. I blew up a
few arcades so people can climb up the tower more easily. Looks quite good to me. The ruin feels more ancient now.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-liyue"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-liyue">Volume 2: Liyue</a></h2>
<p><strong>Dihua Marsh</strong></p>
<p>The northern stretch of the Bishui River turns into a wetland. If you look south beyond the Stone Gate you will see a
Silvergrass marsh as far as the eye can see. At the southernmost point of the marsh is an inn sat atop a giant rock.
That is the Wangshu Inn, the highest point on the entire marsh. Look south from there and you will see the Guili Plains.
You can also make out the Guyun Stone Forest across the sea. Also – there's a weirdo staying at the inn on the top
floor. I don't think I've ever heard him say a single word. Lunch is a true feast at the Wangshu Inn. The kitchen is
equipped with every utensil you could imagine – perfect for getting some practical alchemy experience. On the topic of
alchemy practice, I've got a few new things to test out in my search for an explosion catalyst. If everything goes
smoothly, I'll spend a few more days here then head to the Guili Plains.</p>
<p><strong>Guili Plains</strong></p>
<p>In the end, I came to the Guili Plains a few days earlier than I'd originally planned. Records suggest that prior to the
Archon War, this area was a thriving marketplace. The foxes and wild finches are stunning here, their fur and feathers
have a certain glow about them. But I hear that they can be pests, too. Liyue locals complain that they keep eating
their fruit offerings to the Geo Archon. I wonder if that gives them a fruity aroma when roasted? Maybe I should go
hunting. They run a strict operation at the checkpoint on the main road, but the guards who work there are friendly
people. I made a potion from some local herbs and gave it to one of them for his stutter – it cured him, but it did have
some minor side effects. He now can't help but constantly imitate everyone he comes across. Not just what they say, but
the way they say it. It's uncanny how spot-on his impressions are.</p>
<p><strong>Jueyun Karst</strong></p>
<p>I'm told that somewhere amidst the misty peaks of Jueyun Karst lives an adeptus, the exact location hidden somewhere in
the ocean of cloud. All the Liyue herb gatherers claim to have seen the realm of the adepti in all its glory revealed
before their very eyes in the clouds. Based on personal experience, I can say that over-indulging on certain types of
mushrooms can induce visions of a similar nature. The terrain here fascinates me. So many of these Stone Pillars look
like they belong deep underground, not here on top of a mountain. There is supposed to be an underground reservoir here.
Part of me wonders if all the water was drawn out, perhaps Jueyun Karst would find itself back on the ocean floor where
it belongs. My travel companion Zhongli is the sternest person I know, but he seems most entertained by this theory. He
won't stop laughing. What an odd fellow.</p>
<p><strong>Yaoguang Shoal</strong></p>
<p>I've heard that the fog often rolls in off the sea onto Yaoguang Shoal, and when it's at its thickest you can barely see
your hand at the end of your outstretched arm. Unfortunately, I didn't make it here in time to see a foggy episode. It's
a bit of a shame. There are so many lovely shells on the beach. I wonder how many of them have been there since the
Archon War? I strung some of them together to make a necklace, but unfortunately that fisherman from the inn sat on it
and broke it... Every last shell, brutally crushed beneath his merciless buttocks. None were spared. Not only that, but
because he injured himself on the shards of broken shell, I had to pay his medical bills. A giant sea-snail shell stands
on the beach where the Bishui River enters the sea. A kind old lady lives inside. Her family is said to have sailed here
on the giant shell, and she spends her time rescuing shipwrecked people who end up drifting near the shore. I think that
repurposing the giant shell as a self-propelled boat would make it much easier for her to rescue people from the sea.
But after I lost control of my third prototype seashell-boat and it blew up, the kind old lady decided she was not going
to rescue me from the sea anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Guyun Stone Forest</strong></p>
<p>This is the site where the Geo Archon defeated the sea monster. Some of the great stone Poles that pierce the ocean
floor still tower above the surface of the sea, though many snapped long ago. The hexagonal Stone Pillars, formed from a
conglomeration of Geo energy, are quite intriguing to look at. Viewed from above, one gets the impression that they were
deliberately arranged in their current form to make a specific shape on the ocean surface. Maybe that was the real
reason the Geo Archon rained down destruction on the ocean floor with his stone Poles? Maybe it was all just a big joke,
albeit in extremely poor taste? Zhongli from Liyue Harbor seems extremely knowledgeable on Liyue folklore, but I've
never actually seen him come here. I can see the Wangshu Inn in the distance. I'll bet that weirdo I met there last time
is still staring this way now. The flow of the ley lines around here are unique in all of Liyue. Much more dynamic,
somewhat unstable... It's as if a great, relentless power stirs somewhere in the depths of the ocean. Perhaps it is the
defeated sea monster, still writhing on the ocean floor.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-inazuma"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-inazuma">Volume 3: Inazuma</a></h2>
<p><strong>Mt. Yougou</strong></p>
<p>Lush sakura trees grow all over this mountain on the northern end of Narukami Island. These sakura all share roots with
the largest of them, the Sacred Sakura, which sits on the mountain's summit. The Grand Narukami Shrine, greatest of the
Inazuman shrines, is dedicated to this Sacred Sakura. Little Yae has been the one managing the shrine in recent years.
Ah, how she's grown! It's just a shame, really, to think that I can never again make her cry as easily as I used to.
Really, I'd thought that she'd quickly get drunk, start to cry, and start talking all silly, but she drunk me under the
table instead... I made a fool of myself in the process and was quite thoroughly mocked for it. Getting made out to be
some old woman who got what was coming to her... Bah. ...And here I was looking to tease that little girl a bit more,
too.</p>
<p><strong>Inazuma City</strong></p>
<p>I brought a new firework formula to that Naganohara kid's place. But when he heard me talking about a new medicine that
might cure his deafness, he demurred and did not accept it. This kid is ever the conservative about explosives, always
diluting them to the point where they cannot cause any obvious physical changes to the environment, and always relying
on the combustion of different metals to produce monotonous visual effects. And he only does tests inside his workshop!
I mean, come on, where's the fun in that? Ah, such a waste, such a waste!</p>
<p>Now as for his daughter, Yoimiya, now she's an interesting young lady. We collected a lot of sweets during the festival
and tried all kinds of new formulae out. That was so much fun! ...And then we got packed off to a deserted beach by the
fire brigade. Something about new rules with which to keep the peace in Inazuma City, or something similarly silly.</p>
<p>We discussed a lot of new ideas, and she even gave me some constructive feedback. A talented kid, this one is. If the
paradise I made for Klee also had one of Yoimiya's fireworks performances, that would have been perfect! It's just a
shame that that grumpy Shogun kept too close an eye on us — or else I'd have helped her improve some of her gadgets, or
even spirited her away. This reminds of the time, not long ago, when I was preparing a medicine that would allow for
flight in the Imperial Kitchen. It blew up due to a mistake of mine, injuring a young tengu general to the point where
her left wing would have needed, say, half a month to recover. I had wanted to help her patch the wound up, but it seems
as if she's been avoiding me ever since... Well, I left her some medicine all the same, just to see how its effects
would turn out. After that incident, it seems that person who spends all her time holed up in Tenshukaku has sent some
soldiers specifically to watch my every move. I mean, that's a bit much. I even apologized right to her face, but she
just won't let up. She was the one who'd allowed me to conduct experiments in the Imperial Kitchen in the first place,
you know?</p>
<p>Also, Ms. Kamisato declined my idol group invitation for the sixth time running. Ah, what a disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>Tatarasuna</strong></p>
<p>Tatarasuna is an island chain that is naturally shaped like a ring. The mountains rise to overlook the sea, surrounding
the large blast furnace in the middle. This is where Inazuman Jade Steel is produced and endlessly made into the best
weaponry for the highfalutin bigwigs of Inazuma — ore made from the blood and bones of a defeated god. This place is the
Tenryou Commissioner's pride and joy, and as such, he takes extra good care of the workers and technical specialists. I
was accompanied during my time at Tatarasuna by a lady named Kagami Gozen. She seems to be a leader amongst the workers
there, and has an official Shogunate post. Even though she's the Tenryou Commissioner's subordinate, she very much looks
like his equal in front of the workers. All of them trust and love her. I'd daresay that their respect for her
dispatches might be even greater than what they give the Shogun... But Kagami Gozen herself frowns often. Very
unfriendly-looking.</p>
<p>The Tatarasuna workers are largely rootless, washed up on these shores by the waves of history. Their many tattoos and
working songs set them apart, but also strengthens their mutual bonds.</p>
<p>Like the other workers at Tatarasuna, Kagami Gozen's body has scars from high-temperature burns from Tatarigami. These
may be signs of short-lived or ill people in the eyes of outsiders, but here, it is how they identify family.</p>
<p>I took the liberty of modifying the Mikage Furnace, throwing a few valves and panels into the sea and improving the
containment dome, which at present can, at best, be rated &quot;better than nothing.&quot; I wonder if those engineers from
Fontaine will be pleasantly surprised? Old man Kujou might get a little upset from production going down, but at least
the furnace isn't going to go haywire from overheating, and I believe that even in the event of a war, which may soon
come, the explosion should not be too large. &quot;Large&quot; according to my personal standards, of course.</p>
<p>Hmm, actually, might my ingenious interventions perhaps prevent war from breaking out at all? Well, I for one would be
more than pleased to see the expressions on those astrologers' faces when their predictions come to naught! Hah!</p>
<p><strong>Yashiori Island</strong></p>
<p>Ah, the clear blue skies over Yashiori Island really is a pleasant sight. Those stodgy onmyouji explained that the
Raiden Shogun placed many &quot;wards&quot; over this place to prevent the corruption that seeps from the remnants of the serpent
god... or something like that. I'm not good with their religious jargon. As far as I can observe, those lamp posts are
quite interesting. Although they have the appearance of items dedicated to the Electro Archon, the techniques used to
make them are quite familiar to me. Oh, whoa, would you look at that! This is supposed to be a travelogue, not an
academic paper!</p>
<p>We were warmly welcomed by Washizu, the head of Higi Village. The grilled fish and onigiri were great! Also, that place
they call Nazuchi Beach is full of friendly pirates... Ah, it's just a shame that I couldn't stay on this island for
longer. The mines on the island are busy places indeed, but the equipment they use there is quite backward. Even though
the Shogun put all those wards down, blocking off most of the Tatarigami's spread, but many miners have still contracted
chronic illnesses from prolonged exposure to the influence of those snake-bone crystals.</p>
<p>The Sakura Mochi that the onmyouji brought with them are very tasty, but they're hardly the equal of the beauties that
Little Yae makes.</p>
<p>I should probably pay a visit to Asase Shrine later. I wonder how that fat cat's been doing lately... I did try to catch
it with specially-crafted cage [sic] the other time, only to be stopped by that killjoy shrine maiden.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="1000-years-of-loneliness"><a class="header" href="#1000-years-of-loneliness">1000 Years of Loneliness</a></h1>
<p>Many years later, when Gothson's ankle would become trapped in the same unlucky beast trap he had laid, he must have
recalled the afternoon when his father had taken him into the city to take part in Ludi Harpastum.</p>
<p>Gothson's whole life was, without a doubt, unfortunate. But he could never quite recall when his misfortunes had begun.
He spent his childhood in Springvale, under the protection of the spring fairy. Indeed, all the hunters lived peaceful
and carefree lives.</p>
<p>When Gothson was seven summers old, his father took him to Mondstadt to watch the circus at Ludi Harpastum. This was the
first time Gothson had entered the city in his life. He was held spellbound by the aromas of sweets and roasted meats,
the brilliant lights and colored paper, the clowns who trained wild boars, and the magicians and their tricks.</p>
<p>In his dazzling childhood memories, Gothson dimly saw his father walking into the reveling crowds, passing through an
archway marked with the words &quot;Pile 'Em Up Contest,&quot; and slowly moving further away from him. But his attention was
drawn to the shining fairy of the spring.</p>
<p>Perhaps he came to understand in his later years that the spirit at the festival was no more than an actor paid 20 Mora
a day, but in his young mind, that sight was always one full of fantastical imagination.</p>
<p>Gothson was lulled to sleep by the spring fairy's stories, and far abroad did he wander and adventure in his boundless
dreams. In an adventurer's dream, he saw rainbow jam pour forth from the mouth of an ancient relief. Gothson was about
to step up and partake of it, when his dream was shattered by the sound of a fracas.</p>
<p>&quot;Run!&quot; His father's panicked, pudgy face, smeared all over with fruit juice and meat sauce, dominated his vision.</p>
<p>Over his shoulder, Gothson could see a towering stack of roasted meat under a glowing red light, tottering and trembling
as it bent his way amid the horrified cries of the crowd.</p>
<p>In his flight, Gothson's father knocked a fat lady over, and threw his own hip. At once he fell, his full weight
collapsing upon his son. Then, the leaning tower of roasted meat collapsed to echoing screams...</p>
<p>The Knights of Favonius took three days to finally clear up the roast meat, vegetables, food items, and other odds and
ends that had been scattered all around the square—not to mention carry off those who had gotten a little too out of
their gourds. From then on, they were forced to declare, all future Ludi Harpastums would have to be held outside the
city.</p>
<p>So it was, then, that Gothson's house was short two hunters and had two sick people added to their number, all in one
night.</p>
<p>What did they get for it? A gold-plated champion's medal—two days late, to boot.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="a-drunkards-tale"><a class="header" href="#a-drunkards-tale">A Drunkard's Tale</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-2"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-2">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>In the land where the dandelion wine flows like a river, tall tales have a way of spreading far and wide, following
closely in the wake of the whiff of wine. Far-fetched fables are always sure to spread when boasted between burps by
inebriated bar patrons. For these stories share something in common with the slurred speech and sea-sickness-inducing
swaying that so often accompanies them, which is that despite being clumsy and awkward, they are also highly
entertaining.</p>
<p>Legend has it that there was once a famous drunkard in Mondstadt. It was said that he could hold his alcohol as well as
any hunter from Springvale in the off season. And yet, still he would drink till he was drunk, every time that he drank:
He would not budge so much as an inch back from the bar at the tavern until not a single Mora was left in his coin
pouch, and not a single drop of wine remained in his glass.</p>
<p>One night, this drunkard was doing his best to stumble home after a particularly satisfying session of especially heavy
drinking. A combination of his spinning head, blurred vision, and zigzagging stride served to navigate him towards a
forest populated by wolves.</p>
<p>Today, of course, Wolvendom is presided over by the Great Wolf King of the North, and the ominous atmosphere that
emanates from inside the forest is sufficient to deter most sober-headed visitors from approaching the area. According
to the elderly hunters, the Wolf King gathered the spirits of the wolves there to prevent outsiders from trespassing
into territory where they are not welcome. But this was an age long before the Wolf King and the north wind had
descended upon that forest, bringing order and peace to the wolven race. At that time, the forest was a perilous place
where wild wolves fought for survival. A fierce blood feud between wolves played out deep inside the dense foliage,
concealed from view and unbeknownst to any man.</p>
<p>Least of all to the drunkard, who had by this point managed to transport his drunken self quite some distance inside the
forest.</p>
<p>He stumbled forward in the darkness with that dogged determination that only drunkards possess, deterred neither by the
tree roots that would trip him up every few steps, nor by the stray branches that would slyly slap him in the face from
time to time. Before long, a pair of green eyes began darting through the forest, their gaze fixed on him, tracking his
every move. Those eyes belonged to a lone wolf, who silently pursued the drunkard from behind, all the while musing to
itself: &quot;This is the most peculiar sight I have ever seen in all my life.&quot;</p>
<p>No one had dared set foot in the wolves' forest in hundreds of years, be they a knight clad top to toe in shining steel
armor or a desperate fugitive dressed in rags. Even the callous nobles refused to exile their slaves there, for fear of
inciting the wrath of the wild wolves and bringing unwanted trouble to their own territory.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet, this odd fellow dares to stroll in here all by himself. How very strange indeed!&quot; The lone wolf pondered this
strange phenomenon as it followed the drunken intruder through the forest, doing its best to ignore the stench of
alcohol that was wafting its way.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-2"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-2">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>It is a well-known fact that wolves have a far keener sense of smell than humans. Another way of putting this is that
their noses are much more sensitive. Little wonder, then, that the stench of alcohol emanating from the wolf's now
historically intoxicated prey was quite stifling, and caused tears to well up in its eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Awoo...&quot; the wolf thought to itself. Having been born in the wilderness and grown up in the forest, the wolf had never
had any contact with human civilization before this night, and though it had once caught the faint scent of wine wafting
across Cider Lake, it did not know the scent's origin, less still understand the significance of that substance to human
kind.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps this peculiar fellow is a relative of the skunk, for it seems that he discovered my presence quite some time
ago, and now means to poison me in an effort to secure his escape!&quot; The wolf pondered this possibility as it braced
itself against the onslaught of alcoholic fumes, picked up its pace, and discreetly maneuvered its way into the
drunkard's shadow — the perfect vantage point from which to inspect its prey.</p>
<p>The wolf is a creature of caution and calculation. The drunkard, meanwhile, is a different sort of creature entirely.
And yet, though wine tends to dizzy the mind and dull the senses, it sometimes affords its consumers the curious
capacity to detect the subtlest of changes in the direction of the wind. Perhaps this could explain how a bumbling
drunkard, fumbling through the forest, was suddenly able to discover the presence of a wolf that had been stealthily
following him the entire time. Or perhaps the alcoholic fumes given off by the drunkard were sufficiently potent to
diminish the wolf's mental acuity, to the point that the wolf became less mindful of the terrain beneath its paws, the
resulting sound of snapping twigs thus alerting the prey to the predator's presence.</p>
<p>&quot;Who's that? Don't s'pose you know which way the toilet is, by any chance...?&quot; The bumbling drunkard rubbed his bleary
eyes. &quot;Foul-smelling human,&quot; snarled the wolf, &quot;Who are you, and whence proceeds your stench?&quot; The wolf flared its
nostrils, bored its fangs, and growled.</p>
<p>Not only was the drunkard unafraid when he heard the wolf's gruffly voiced threat, but he even became quite animated.
&quot;My friend!&quot; the drunkard replied, &quot;Clearly I've offended you, somehow... sorry 'bout that... but anyway, Mondstadt
tradition says you're not allowed to be drunk and bored at the same time... So! Here we are, out in the woods on this
glorious moonlit night... How abouts I tell you a story?&quot; His proposal was promptly punctuated by an almighty belch.</p>
<p>Before this point, the wolf had had no intention of listening to the belching buffoon's drunken ramblings. In fact, it
was poised to deliver a fatal blow to its prey by lunging for the neck, sinking its fangs in, and tearing his throat
clean out. But the drunkard's belch blasted a further bout of fumes in the wolf's direction, assailing its nostrils with
such force that it ruined the wolf's appetite entirely. Grudgingly, the wolf agreed. &quot;Grr... Perhaps I'm not so hungry
after all... Let's see what nonsense tale you have to tell.&quot;</p>
<p>The drunkard stretched out his arms and let out a loud yawn, disturbing a few dandelions in the process. And with that,
the drunkard began to tell his tale.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-1">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Legend tells of a lone wolf that roamed a barren wasteland far, far away.</p>
<p>Once, he had been king of his pack, leading them in the hunt, in battle, and in the search for a home... Now, the sole
remaining legacy of those days were the scars that covered his body.</p>
<p>He has led the way as they ran across open plains, navigated through abandoned ruins, and passed through the domains of
monsters and the Seelie. The wasteland was a cruel place. The wolf-king grew older with each passing day, and the other
wolves gradually dispersed. As time went by, the wolf pack's history faded into distant memory, until finally only the
aged wolf-king remained, the sole survivor of its pack.</p>
<p>This wasteland is said to be a land beyond the dominion of the deities, inhabited only by the grotesque ghostly remains
of fallen gods, where the former palaces of the Seelie now stand empty. So when the solitary old wolf passed by a gray
palace and heard the sound of music coming from within, it caught its attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Never before have I heard a sound so pleasing to the ears, whether it be a song of bird or insect, that it stays the
pangs of hunger in my starved stomach as this tune does.&quot; Intrigued, the wolf stepped inside the gray hall, trod across
the overgrown weeds, and passed by a broken sarcophagus, on which a portrait of the deceased ruler was still clearly
visible.</p>
<p>Finally, he came to an inner room, where he saw a fair maiden strumming at her instrument. Her skin was ashen white and
her head was bowed down, her slender fingers gently stroking the fragile strings of the lute as she played a
long-forgotten and mournful melody.</p>
<p>The wolf sat down in front of the pale young maiden and forgot all about the pain of hunger, thirst, and loneliness for
a short while, as it listened in silence to her song.</p>
<p>&quot;The chirping of insects on a long-gone autumn night is the chorus of exiles, singing mankind's most ancient song as
they live out their plight...&quot; &quot;Stripped of all that the body once held close and the soul once held dear, song and
memories are all that now remain of yesteryear.&quot; &quot;The last singers, the first Seelie, they played their final tune in
the halls of angels.&quot;</p>
<p>The tiny Seelie playing in the forest were also drawn to the young maiden's tune, and flocked to her to pay their
respects.</p>
<p>&quot;What is this song that you play?&quot; The wolf asked, puzzled, for it understood every line, every word, every syllable she
spoke — and yet, hers was a language that it had never heard before, quite unlike that of any other living being.</p>
<p>&quot;A song of the Seelie,&quot; Replied the pale young maiden in a soft voice. &quot;Long, long ago, we wrote this song for the human
savages. Yet now, we sing it to mourn our own fate.&quot;</p>
<p>The wolf began to sing along, albeit clumsily, to the maiden's tune. The wolf's voice was husky and broken, filled with
a lifetime of sorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you singing?&quot; The maiden asked of the wolf.</p>
<p>&quot;This is our song,&quot; Responded the wolf.</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds ghastly.&quot; The maiden made no attempt to soften her criticism as she continued to caress the lute strings.
&quot;But, you are welcome to sing along with me all the same.&quot;</p>
<p>And so, a shared chorus sung by fair young maiden and weary old wolf filled the chambers of the long-abandoned palace.
It is said that to this day, adventurers who pass by this place still hear a strange yet harmonious melody sounding from
within.</p>
<p>&quot;And then? ...The story ends here?&quot; The wolf licked its lips, somewhat ruefully, and then said: &quot;I suppose I shall tell
you a story now.&quot;</p>
<p>And with that, the wolf cleared its throat and began to tell its tale.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-1">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>Legend has it that the first wine of Mondstadt was brewed in the age when the north wind howled.</p>
<p>In the age when the Kings of Ice and Frost fought for dominion, Mondstadt's forbears brewed rudimentary wine from wild
fruits, even as they shivered in the biting cold. They did so to ease the pain of their frostbitten fingers and to give
them the courage to face the harsh and unforgiving ice. For at that time, the land of Mondstadt was engulfed by ice and
snow, and the dandelions had not yet reared their heads.</p>
<p>It is said that the first person in Mondstadt to discover the craft of wine brewing was a grossly negligent guard.</p>
<p>In a tribe beset by blizzards on all sides, it was the unenviable job of the hardy hunter-gatherers to stock the storage
pits with food, and it was the guard's task to guard against intruders. The sight of a human intruder was a rare one
indeed in that harsh environment — but there were other creatures who could better withstand the cold, and they would
burrow underground to reach the food stocks. The rules of the tribe were that one person should inspect the storage pits
at all times, filling in any mouse holes discovered — or better still, catching them red-handed in the act of pilfering —
to keep the tribe's food supplies at plentiful levels.</p>
<p>At that time, the damp, dark caves needed constant care and attention to prevent the food they held from going bad and
rotting. On top of this, the mischievous little creatures that hid away out of sight would sometimes play pranks on the
guards.</p>
<p>One day, a wily wind spirit noticed that the grossly negligent guard was once again being grossly negligent. So, the
spirit took the form of a fox and crept into a pile of wild apples. There, it caused yeast to grow, ripening the apples
and causing them to ferment. The grossly negligent guard was ravenous when he returned, and elected to partake of one of
the apples. The mellow taste of fermented fruit delighted both his body and his mind. Immediately, he took animal hide
and squeezed the juice from the apples, creating wine.</p>
<p>The grossly negligent guard who first invented brewing in the age of ice and snow also became Mondstadt's first
drunkard. It is said he was the first person ever to fall into a drunken dream.</p>
<p>In his first drunken dream, he drunkenly dreamt that he had become a lone wolf. Somewhere in the long-lost past or
possibly the far-flung future, he fought fang and claw with rival wolf packs, battled with humans for food in the midst
of a raging snowstorm, and met the first seelie.</p>
<p>The tribe-dwelling human and the pack-dwelling wolf could not bear to live in solitude. This newly brewed wine served to
bring man and wolf together in their dreams.</p>
<p>But their attitudes towards these dreams were poles apart.</p>
<p>The human who knew only the wind and snow yearned for the wasteland where the lone wolf runs freely, but the lone wolf
was fearful of the human's desire. It could not understand why this human was captivated by dangerous illusions and
sought hope from within them. What concerned the wolf even more was that when in a drunken human dream, it could no
longer distinguish whether it was a wolf or a human with a wolven spirit.</p>
<p>So the wolf swore an oath never to touch the humans' poison again, to resist the allure of wine. Wolves are not the
children of the wind, and the land of wine and song is not their home. So the wolves left the humans' domain and settled
far off in the wilderness and deep in the mountain forests, places where the scent of wine could not reach them.</p>
<p>&quot;What you humans call wine, we wolves call the abyss,&quot; The wolf haughtily concluded. But as the wolf turned towards the
drunkard to say this line, it discovered that the drunkard was now lying fast asleep on a bed of pine branches.</p>
<p>The wolf was most displeased, and violently expelled a puff of air from its nostrils before leaving the still-pungent
pile of sleeping human to his business, and going on its way.</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-prologue"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-prologue">Volume 1: Prologue</a></h2>
<p>When our perceptions are unfettered by archons and churches, we shall learn that in northern Teyvat, the people of
Mondstadt preserved their culture as decades ago, even after Barbatos the Anemo Archon concealed himself. When we
observe the daily lives of the people of Mondstadt from a higher perspective, it is evident that the people share a
carefree nature, which mostly stems from their bountiful and pleasant living conditions. The surplus grain produced
became their source of brews, and the brews further nourished their easygoing temperament. Above all, the Anemo Archon
never taught them how to make wine and revel — they discovered it themselves.</p>
<p>But I do not intend to make my readers think that we could do without archons. On the contrary, say, if Barbatos had not
guided the warm monsoons to Mondstadt with his divine powers, would Mondstadt still be so bountiful as to produce the
brews that it does?</p>
<p>The answer would be no. Mondstadt is an inland city and would have struggled to provide for itself if not for the grace
of Barbatos. If we look back through history, we learn that Mondstadt is situated on a land that was once frozen, where
the living conditions were harsh and brewing would be virtually impossible. It was the power of Barbatos that changed
everything.</p>
<p>A cumbersome preface indeed, but I hope that my readers will keep one thing in mind when reading my humble book: while
it is the power of archons that created our living environment, we should be conscious of the fact that what shapes our
thinking, logic, culture, philosophy and aesthetics is not the archons themselves, but the objective environment that
exists around us.</p>
<p>This world around us is what we have inherited, and what this book shows is that the people of Teyvat have always been,
and always will be, heirs to a divine legacy — but not to divinity itself.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ancient-investigation-journal"><a class="header" href="#ancient-investigation-journal">Ancient Investigation Journal</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-3"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-3">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>...The weather remains inclement today. Although the snow and wind are beginning to subside, one is hard-pressed to keep
their eyes open when faced with the occasional gusts that still whip up. Such conditions bring to mind an ancient verse,
where wind and snow are likened by the poet to the lashes of a pale iron sword.</p>
<p>But just as Master Landrich once said, one must press on, no matter the difficulties met along the way. We must return
to Mondstadt bearing great achievements. Only then will I live up to Master Landrich's expectations and bring honor to
my family's name. And only then will the arrogance of those who conspire to rebel be put to rest once and for all.</p>
<p>Based on an inscription, we decided to abandon our original plans of exploring the cellar in the southwestern ruins in
favor of going to a locked secret chamber. According to the inscription text deciphered by Master Eberhart, the chamber
should contain impressive ancient frescoes along with weapons forged from Starsilver. If that's the case, this could
easily be the most significant archaeological discovery in decades.</p>
<p>That's what Master Ingbert said, at least. But somehow my heart still can't forget the companions we lost in the
snowstorm just days before. I sincerely hope that Master Eberhart was right when he said that they were aristocratic
children rigorously trained from childhood, and perfectly capable of making their way back to camp on their own.</p>
<p>We shall soon set off from South Base Camp to delve further into the inner reaches of the ruins. This time, it is
imperative that we closely examine the stability of the ruins before we enter.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-3"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-3">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>Due to the tragedy that befell us previously, I fear that my prior journal entries are now all but lost. It is most
unfortunate that the investigation notes were lost, but the conditions here are truly dangerous.</p>
<p>Alas, we were unable to budge those great doors. In the end, we returned empty-handed, with no sight of the fresco or
the ancient weapons which Master Ingbert so greatly desired to see. Upon returning to South Base Camp, there was still
no sign of the others who had gone missing in the snowstorm. Although the chance may be a slim one, we can only hope
that they made it down the mountain and are now returning with help and more supplies. It certainly won't be long before
our remaining supplies run out. As cruel as it may seem to say such a thing, the cave-in that occurred just before the
round doors of the secret room not only robbed us of Nick, but also all the food and fuel he was carrying. I had said
that it is imperative we first check the structural integrity of these ruins... I clearly remember telling him that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the streak of unfortunate incidents we've encountered in the past few days has caused me to turn bitter. Or
perhaps this is simply the natural toll such desperate conditions take on people.</p>
<p>The fact that Master Eberhart could maintain a level head even in the face of such adverse conditions only made all the
more admirable. Perhaps this is the true tenacity of a young aristocrat. Master Landrich's judgment seems to have been
well-founded. Even as an illegitimate child, he is quite capable of living up to the role of an aristocrat, more so than
most other aristocrats, in fact.</p>
<p>When the storm eases a little, we will proceed to the cellar in the southwestern ruins as per Eberhart's proposal. Based
on the content of what he deciphered, there may be something very ancient within. The sheer cold of this place has the
peculiar and incomprehensible effect of preserving things the way they are.</p>
<p>We must not let down the companions we lost. ...And more importantly, we must not let Master Landrich down. Otherwise, I
will most likely be facing off against monsters in the gladiatorial arena before too long. Even if I beat the monsters,
I would probably share the fate of Eberhart's slave, and meet my demise at the sword of the red-haired reaper of the
Lawrence Clan...</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-2"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-2">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Does the history of this place make the scenery look bleaker? Or is the bleakness of the scenery here responsible for
its grim history in the first place? Could it be that I'm only having these thoughts because of all that has happened
during this investigation? Or perhaps I'm starting to lose my wits due to the blood loss and the sheer cold? Whatever
the answer, one thing I'm fairly certain of is that this will be my last journal entry.</p>
<p>In the end, Eberhart's plan failed... In fact, no. I rather think he succeeded. In hindsight, his actions are all too
clear. I'm surprised none of us saw what he was doing... And now I think about it, I fear that the companions we have
been separated from along the way will have already fallen victim to his treachery. The cave-in in front of the secret
room with the round door was surely all part of his plan.</p>
<p>Only at the very end when he led Master Ingbert and me into the cellar in the southwestern ruins and took out his
polearm did I finally understand. His talk of a &quot;lost civilization buried beneath the snow&quot; and &quot;a power descended from
the heavens&quot; were just a means to an end. He knew Ingbert loved the idea of exploration and adventure and used this to
lure him to a deserted place where no one would be able to help him... When all is said and done, this all comes down to
him being an illegitimate child. The polearm is an inelegant weapon, unbecoming of an aristocrat. I wonder if he
secretly trained to use it for the sole purpose of killing his master here, clearing one more obstacle from his path
towards dominion over the clan.</p>
<p>Now I think about it, Master Parsifal's disobedience, love of chivalric play-acting, and eventual departure must surely
have been encouraged by him behind the scenes...</p>
<p>The image of Ingbert being struck by his polearm is one I shall never be able to get out of my head. We all grew up
together. But none of us saw beyond the kind and gentle facade to the monster he was inside. Landrich was already
planning to bestow the clan name upon him after returning from the investigation anyway. Maybe if he'd known of his
plans, things never would have turned out this way... Or perhaps he did already know of his plans, and that was
precisely what prompted him to take this opportunity to move himself one step closer towards the front in the line of
succession...</p>
<p>I am sorry, Priscilla, for I will not make it back to Mondstadt.</p>
<p>Whoever reads this, please warn Landrich. Eberhart is badly injured too, but there is still a chance he will make it
back to Mondstadt. And if that happens... There will only be one more obstacle left for him on his road to revolt.</p>

<p>Down every street in Mondstadt have I strolled.<br />
The air was filled with the stench of misery and the buzz of revelry.<br />
I saw the most arrogant of aristocrats,<br />
And I saw the most pitiful of the impoverished.<br />
At night these streets are a spider's web—some here to feast, others their eternal prey.<br />
I hear a jangling in the night, and know it is the chains that fetter the souls of the oppressed.</p>
<p>I patrol the streets of Mondstadt at nighttime,<br />
Where my peers and superiors would once declare:<br />
&quot;We are the starlit knights, lift thy heads and bear witness!&quot;<br />
&quot;For we, who raise our flag in the splendor of starlight, are the true protectors of Mondstadt!&quot;<br />
But not once have I lifted my head to the stars, or gazed at our flag:<br />
For I cannot shift my focus from the filthy street corners.</p>
<p>Destitute peddlers weep in silence.<br />
Aging soldiers grimace in pain.<br />
In the deathly stillness of night,<br />
A young girl, rejected by the Aristocracy, pleads for Barbatos' mercy.<br />
The sighing of mournful winds rattles the Cathedral gate,<br />
Carrying within them the grief of the oppressed, they assault splendid palatial walls.</p>
<p>Each mother's call,<br />
Each infant's cry,<br />
Enough to dent the hardest of shields.<br />
Enough to shatter the sharpest of swords.</p>
<p>Sounds of sorrow send shivers down my spine.<br />
But in the palace, and in the castle,<br />
Though the wind blows the same over holy ground,<br />
They are but the sighs of ants to the ears of men.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-4"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-4">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>One day, at the crack of dawn,<br />
A dancer whose sword was her song set foot in Mondstadt.<br />
Though clad in chains with cuffed hands and fettered feet,<br />
In her silence lay a song:<br />
It was the song of freedom. A song of a brighter dawn beyond the walls,<br />
A joyous ballad sung without reservation by a people unrestrained.</p>
<p>She was the dawnlight of the Wanderer's Troupe,<br />
But she spelled eternal midnight for the Aristocracy.<br />
I once asked her, &quot;Why do you come to overthrow our aristocrats?&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you not know that they are the first among us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wherefore do you place their lives on a pedestal?&quot;<br />
Came her voice, like a fresh breeze,<br />
&quot;If you claim to know the wind as your companion,&quot;<br />
&quot;Then did you not once know freedom, too?&quot;</p>
<p>To her lonesome listeners she told a tale:<br />
A tale of our rulers' better ancestors who held divine power,<br />
A tale of angels, gods and vile dragons,<br />
A tale of the deities and peoples of all the land.<br />
Each myth and legend she turned to song,<br />
And the wind carried the song to all corners of the land.</p>
<p>In the aristocrats' arena, her sword sang once more:<br />
Her final masterpiece, but it stopped short of perfection.<br />
A nameless knight retrieved her sword from the blood-soaked battlefield.<br />
And buried it where the gentle winds meet in communion.</p>

<p>May the gentle breeze of Barbatos carry words of enlightenment and deliver them into the gaze of my readers. And may the
wind of freedom forever prevail in Mondstadt.</p>
<p>The story of the Gunnhildr Clan begins in legend, three thousand years ago during the war between the Lord of the Tower,
Decarabian, and the King of the North Wind, Andrius. It was a time when Mondstadt was a frozen wasteland, and Gunnhildr
was about to become the strongest leader her nomadic clan had ever seen.</p>
<p>Gunnhildr's father, the then-leader of the clan, had once served under Decarabian. He served until he found the despotic
rule of the aloof and selfish king to be more than he could bear, whereupon he had led his clan outside of the city
where ferocious winds howled without mercy. But life in the wasteland beyond the city gates was harsh and unforgiving.
Though they had escaped the wrath of a tyrant, they were now faced with the wrath of relentless and all-engulfing
blizzards.</p>
<p>Just when all hope seemed to be lost for the wandering clan, a spirit from the midst of the myriad winds heard
Gunnhildr's prayers. The sincere plea of a clan chief's young daughter joined with a people's cry of help, a cry that
the blizzard had all but drowned out, and became a faith. The faith gathered in front of the wind spirit like water
flowing into a spring and became the source from which the wind spirit drew its power. The wind spirit used this power
to make a small shelter for the clan, and bestowed upon the clan chief's daughter the power to protect.</p>
<p>After her father's death, Gunnhildr took his place as the clan's leader. She also became its first priestess. From that
day forth, she protected her clan faithfully. When the Anemo Archon Barbatos challenged the aloof and selfish king
Decarabian's rule, Gunnhildr led her people to make a stand against the Archon's fury. But when Barbatos finally fought
through the ferocious winds and freed the tyrant's subjects, she was also the one who decorated the victorious Anemo
Archon with laurels.</p>
<p>In later times, after Barbatos had departed, a class of aristocrats emerged across the land. These rulers, who were
possessed of divine power, would become corrupted and turn to tyranny themselves a thousand years later, but none had
the ability to predict the distant future. Not even Barbatos himself.</p>
<p>Gunnhildr's descendants were themselves a prominent clan within the Aristocracy. But unlike the evil and scheming
Lawrence Clan, the Gunnhildrs upheld their legacy of protecting Mondstadt that was always enshrined in their motto, &quot;for
Mondstadt, as always,&quot; doing everything within their power to protect its people. During the later struggle to overthrow
the Aristocracy, they took the side of the people of Mondstadt. For this reason, they were spared the sentence of exile
that was imposed on the rest of the Aristocracy.</p>
<p>Today, the Gunnhildr Clan is a source of many brave knights and outstanding clergy members that serve in the Knights of
Favonius. If history can teach us anything at all about the future, perhaps it is that the Gunnhildr Clan will continue
honoring the legacy of its ancestors and its duty to the Anemo Archon: to protect Mondstadt, the land and all who
inhabit it, forever.</p>

<p>&quot;Breeze Amidst the Forest&quot; and &quot;Breeze Upon the Lake&quot; constitute a two-volume collection of narrative poems. The
compilation is the result of the tireless work of scholars who have recorded and arranged countless songs sung by
Mondstadt bards.</p>
<p>Bards often elaborate or fabricate history to draw in an audience and earn a few extra Mora. Hence, most of their works
have extremely low credibility. What has allowed the songs to remain popular to this day, and to stand the test of the
thousand winds of time, is the threads of spectacular imagination and ingenious rhetoric that have been woven into them.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;What to be sung hails from ancient times.&quot;<br />
&quot;The gods walked among us in their prime.&quot;</p>
<p>The poet, who had finished recounting the tales of the ruins and Vennessa, began to tell the story of the Wind Dragon.
He began to sing, &quot;The story to be told hails from ancient times, when the gods walked among us in their prime.&quot; The
dragon graced by Anemo was born* in the high heavens in that age of wonders. He slowly descended, and inspected
everything with curious eyes.</p>
<p>He landed in a village, only for the terrified villagers to throw rocks at him. The dragon could not understand why they
cried in fear. He landed in a cemetery, only to hear the lament of grieving people. The dragon could not understand what
they murmured in sorrow. He landed in an orchard, only to be cursed by the furious farmers who lost their trees. The
dragon could not understand why they screamed in anger.</p>
<p>The world was too complicated for a young dragon. The dragon was bewildered, yet he did not give up.</p>
<p>One day, the dragon heard music pouring out from the Holy Lyre der Himmel. This was the name of the lyre belonging to
the Anemo Archon. Enchanted by the poetry, the Wind Dragon landed beside the best singer under the skies.</p>
<p>People panicked, for the mighty elemental dragons and the great archons that reigned over the earth had never seen eye
to eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Behold his beauty and benignity!&quot; The Windborne Bard sang.</p>
<p>&quot;But we do not know him,&quot; the people replied.</p>
<p>What mysterious magic lies behind music and poetry that has the power to mesmerize both dragons and humans alike? I, for
one, cannot fathom it. The dragon decided to stay with the bard, for he too wished to be understood by all souls. He
learned human speech and Windborne Bard's singing techniques.</p>
<p>...omitted...</p>
<p>Later generations regarded him as one of the Four Winds that watched over and protected Mondstadt.</p>
<p>&quot;An atrous sun befell its kingdom and a luminous pearl lost its glow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Niveous silk grew dim and wheaten gold burned brilliantly no more.&quot;</p>
<p>So begins another tale that occurred in the lost Khaenri'ah Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Eclipse Dynasty had fallen, and disaster spread across the land. The alchemist known as Gold was corrupted by their
own greed and ambition, and created an army of shadowy monsters with their uncanny powers. Durin, a black serpentine
dragon, rose from the sea to cast its shadow over Mondstadt. But it was at this very moment that there was no one to
inherit the title of Lionfang Knight, thus, the Knights of Favonius could not fly their falcon flag.</p>
<p>The persistent yet despondent prayers called upon the archon of Mondstadt, the Windborne Bard. The strings of the lyre
were strummed once more, and the Wind Dragon was summoned forth.</p>
<p>As Mondstadt's last line of defense, the Wind Dragon battled the wicked dragon to the death in raging storms.</p>
<p>The Wind Dragon prevailed. He tore open the throat of the wicked dragon, at the cost of ingesting its poisonous blood.
The blood of the wicked dragon was distorted gold, with the powers to crumble mountains and poison the earth.</p>
<p>The Wind Dragon protected Mondstadt with his life, and his only wish was to be understood by humans. And so, he drifted
off into a deep slumber.</p>
<p>The Holy Lyre played a sorrowful tune.</p>
<p>The Holy Lyre sang: should you awaken, spread your wings and live your life freely! A dragon is born to soar the skies,
and mortals shall surely grasp your beauty...</p>
<p>(*Typically, when life arises from the elements, it either descends and becomes a slime, or ascends and becomes a
crystalfly. Rarely does this process give rise to dangerous elemental monsters. Elemental dragons are rarely seen and
have the powers to match the gods of old.)</p>

<p>An excerpt from &quot;An Investigation into the Cultural Customs of the Wind Kingdom,&quot; more commonly known as &quot;Records of
Customs and Culture,&quot; by Jacob Musk.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The &quot;Wolf&quot; of the Knight of Boreas, the &quot;Lion&quot; of the Lionfang Knight (or &quot;Dandelion Knight&quot;), the &quot;Falcon&quot; of the
Knights of Favonius, and the &quot;Wind Dragon&quot; Dvalin have been long regarded as the Four Winds that watch over Mondstadt.</p>
<p>After the Lionfang Knight liberated Mondstadt, the Knights of Favonius was established, and the Knight of Boreas joined
them.</p>
<p>The tradition of worshipping the Four Winds was gradually formed in Mondstadt. However, Dvalin, the ancient Wind Dragon,
predated them all.</p>
<p>Approximately one hundred years ago, the land was in chaos. Darkness spread, contaminating everything it touched.
Barbarians and foul creatures roamed the lands, forcing people to dwell within the city walls.</p>
<p>It was an especially difficult time for Mondstadt. The Lionfang Knight was without a suitable heir, and the Knights of
Favonius had lost many of its brave men and women during the bitter wars. During the most difficult of times, Durin, the
corrupted dragon of immeasurable power, began attacking Mondstadt.</p>
<p>The prayers of Mondstadt's people awoke the Anemo Archon, and his will summoned forth the Wind Dragon Dvalin. As the
last defender of Mondstadt, Dvalin battled Durin with all his might.</p>
<p>The result was clear — Durin's remains still lie atop the snowy peaks to the south of Mondstadt — but the story of how
the battle ended was lost in time. It is said that Dvalin ripped out Durin's throat, and together they fell from the
sky. Durin's body sunk into the snow while Dvalin was summoned by the Anemo Archon and fell into a slumber.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>People used to believe that Dvalin would awaken whenever Mondstadt faces a new threat.</p>
<p>But in these times of peace, the belief of the Four Winds has gradually eroded and their temples lie all but completely
deserted.</p>
<p>(Citation of unknown origin: By the time the Knights finally discovered that the foreign monstrosity named Stormterror,
with which they clashed countless times, was in fact Dvalin of the Four Winds, the enmity that had grown between them
and driven them to conflict could not be undone. One can scarcely imagine the betrayal Dvalin must have felt when he
awoke after a hundred years of slumber only to find that the people of Mondstadt, whom he had protected with his life,
had forsaken him...)</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-5"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-5">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>Under the cascading moonlight, a tearful boy made his wish at the spring. A fairy from afar, who had taken up residence
in the unoccupied spring, listened in silence to his wordless wish.</p>
<p>Spring fairies know nothing of distant memories or deep dreams. They are born of water's essence, faceless descendants
of the angels. Thus, when the curious fairy emerged from the water and heard the cry of that boy's heart, she became
interested in this life, younger and more fragile than her own. The silent fairy reached out her formless fingers, cold
as the midnight dew and soft as fortune forgone and gently caressed the boy's forehead and cheeks.</p>
<p>Startled by this stranger's touch, the young boy lifted his head and met the fairy's gaze. &quot;Can you make my wish come
true?&quot; The boy asked. The fairy of the spring was surprised and confused by this presumptuous question. But she could
not speak, and so simply nodded her head. Satisfied, the boy left.</p>
<p>He did not know that the spring fairy was alone, without friends or family, and that she had lost a great deal of her
wisdom. Only when the spring water flowed from cracks in the stone into her pool, and when she gazed upon the fractured
image of the moon in the rippling water, did she slowly regain the ability to think, and to mimic fragments of speech.
Like a curious child, the fairy observed the world around her in innocence, wonder, and love. She rejoiced with the fox
and squirrel who stole berries, and grieved at the dark clouds that covered the horizon.</p>
<p>And for that young boy, a feeling complex yet immature welled forth from within her heart. All alone in this world, she
had neither the power nor wisdom with which to grant his wish. But she could share it, and she drew life from sharing
his burdens.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-5"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-5">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>As he gazed at the fractured image of the moon carried by the water's ripples, the boy poured his heart out to the
spring. From within his words, she learned much of him. And from her silence, he strengthened his belief in himself.</p>
<p>Dimly, the spring fairy understood that there was good in the world beyond moonlight and fruits, and more to darkness
than mere clouds. The boy spoke to her of forests and trees, cities and walls, and shared with her his joys, his sorrows
and his fears. As she listened to him, she became enamored of this imperfect world into which she had been born.</p>
<p>When the boy grew frustrated at his powerlessness, the spring fairy would gently and quietly wipe away his tears. From
them, she grew to understood the world outside the spring a little more. Those tears flowed into the water, and the
fairy purified them, turning them into a sweet nectar that brought him sweet dreams. The boy forgot the pain of his
waking hours, and met the silent fairy by her spring in his sleep.</p>
<p>Every time that happened, the fairy too would smile, asleep in the pool drenched in moonlight. The fresh dew nourished
the boy's dreams, and the boy's dreams rejunvenated the lonely fairy's soul. In those dreams, the spring fairy told the
boy tales of the faraway realm of Hydro. She spoke of her sapphire-blue homeland, she sang of the homesickness of exile,
and she sighed for separation and belonging. In these dreams, the boy became the one who silently listened, who wept for
her troubles, and who rejoiced in her happiness.</p>
<p>Over time, the spring fairy gained the power of speech from the boy's memories and dreams. Over time, they became
friends who shared all.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-3"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-3">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>When the wind ceased to blow, the moon's fractured reflection in the pool was made whole, and the boy heard the fairy's
voice for the first time. Fairies are tender, sensitive beings beyond the ken of humans, and the boy was deeply taken by
her gentle, elegiac voice.</p>
<p>But fairies being tender and sensitive beyond human ken, through his eyes she saw his naked yearning, and the promise
that was about to leave his lips.</p>
<p>And suddenly, the fairy was afraid.</p>
<p>Mortal lives are strong but fleeting, and the boy must grow, and grow old. Once youth and innocence had faded, how would
he treat his elemental descendants? In the twilight of his life, would he blame himself for throwing his life away for a
childish promise?</p>
<p>The spring fairy was pure and kind but she did not understand human love. She had never seen the miracle of humanity,
and had merely sat idle through millennia of change. And so, she greatly feared parting.</p>
<p>What humans see as the miracle of devotion, elemental fairies can only perceive as fleeting pleasure. And even the power
of fairies cannot reserve the aging of a loved one.</p>
<p>The tender fairy could not bear to see that unavoidable day come, and with a kiss she stopped the boy from uttering the
words. But the boy, in his innocence, mistook her rejection as her approval of his promise.</p>
<p>From that moment, the fairy vowed that she would someday bear to leave him. And the boy vowed that he would remain by
her spring forever.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-2"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-2">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>By and by, the young boy grew up, made new friends and had new experiences. And the spring fairy, as she had in his
youth, sang him her quiet elegies each one.</p>
<p>Till the day came at last, when she left, and grazed no more upon the boy. Never again did words flow forth from the
trickling sound of the spring. Never again would the fractured moon become whole. The spring fairy suddenly realized
that though she had found a place to belong, and though she had experienced fleeting happiness, she was still alone.</p>
<p>The boy, now no longer a boy, could not perceive her flight, and blamed himself for his own solitude. &quot;Perhaps she was
merely a childish fantasy.&quot; He would think this to himself as he listened to the gurgling of the spring.</p>
<p>But that cool kiss was real, as was the wind that once played with her hair. Suddenly, he realized that though he had
met and parted with countless new friends, and though he had adventured and returned more times than he could remember,
he was still alone in the end.</p>
<p>So, as they had done many years ago, the boy's tears fell into the pure pond, soaking into the fractured moon. But this
time, the spring fairy did not come as promised. Stubbornly she turned her back, willing to be the object of an innocent
childhood dream, to be a fleeting guest wandering from a foreign land, but unwilling to allow her near-eternal life to
break her lover's promise.</p>
<p>Legend has it that whenever the rain pours down, the raindrops that fall into the pond mix with the tears of the spring
fairy. To his dying day, the boy believed wholeheartedly in this groundless superstition. But sadly, the spring fairy
who fled from her true feelings could never believe it herself.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hex--hound"><a class="header" href="#hex--hound">Hex &amp; Hound</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-6"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-6">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>As is known to all, the Lawrence clan is a noble family of considerable notoriety. The nobles idle away their time,
extorting the common folk to furnish their lavish lifestyles. They lead licentious lives. Under their cruel governance,
countless unspeakable crimes are committed against the people. Although the common folk unanimously resent the nobles'
greed, they are powerless to speak a single word against them.</p>
<p>Young Dietrich was a highborn noble. He hadn't yet committed any deplorable crimes at his tender age. In fact, his
swordsmanship was reputedly exceptional among the noble circles. If you wished to find something to cavil about, it
would have been his short temper and chronic delusion that the whole universe revolved around him. Such traits, of
course, are not uncommon among the sons of nobility, so it wasn't of any major concern. However, given that he was born
into the Lawrence family name, it was only a matter of time before he would get drafted into the ranks of the other
scoundrels.</p>
<p>It was at this time that the young scoundrel decided upon the first reckless act of his life. A short while earlier,
Dietrich had made up his mind to skip Tutor Damo's discourse on the elements in favor of a bit of fun outside the
confines of the city. As he pressed his way through the streets crowded with commoners, his gaze fell upon a young lass
with blonde hair and blue eyes. Dietrich was at a loss for words for the emotions that bubbled in his heart at that
moment. The only thing he was certain of was that his heart had never thumped so loudly, or so uncontrollably, within
his chest. &quot;So this must be how dear Mother feels when she sees her kitty.&quot; As Dietrich kept thinking in his heart, he
suddenly found himself moving towards where she was standing.</p>
<p>Much to his dismay, the young commoner girl didn't so much as bat an eyelid at him. After making his identity known to
her, she didn't display even the slightest sign of any interest. Convinced that this commoner didn't understand what was
good for her, he decided that he would carry her off under the cover of night.</p>
<p>&quot;Once I take her, I'll lock her away in a cage, just like dear Mother would when her kitty is being naughty.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-6"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-6">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>The plebian lass arrived in the city on one fine sunny day. Her long golden hair shone like the spring sunshine, and her
blue eyes sparkled like the gleaming waves in the afternoon sun. It's hard to imagine how such a girl could travel alone
from the monster infested outskirts all the way to the city.</p>
<p>&quot;To call her suspect would only be an insult to her beauty!&quot; Thus shouted the drunken gate sentry among the crowded
tavern. His earnings from guarding the gate that day were especially bountiful, enough to keep his cup brimming until
dawn at least. &quot;We all know you were just dumbstruck by her beauty!&quot; The man next to him pulled no punches. &quot;Hah, what
do you know! Do I look like one to go frolicking after ladies? I'll show you what I really have my eye on!&quot; The soldier
promptly pulled out his money purse and shook it in his hand. &quot;Good heavens! Today, drinks are on you!&quot; &quot;You heard the
man, drinks all around! I'm just worried that one more will be too many for ya!&quot; ...</p>
<p>So this traveling scholar who went by the name of Nottie settled into her newfound life in the city. Nottie spoke in a
quiet, gentle manner. A rumor eventually began floating around the streets claiming that if you exchanged a few words
with Nottie during the day, you would have sweet dreams the following night. Apart from this, the new girl didn't
disturb the lives if those in the city in any manner. After all, the people not only had their daily lives to deal with,
but also the constant oppression from the nobility.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I thought life in the city would be simple. I never imagined it would be like this...&quot; As rays of sunset filled her
room, she tilted her head and rested it on her hands. Sitting beside the table, her fingers seemed to be circling around
something. Her words flowed like a magical chant with the power to persuade people into believing almost anything.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-4"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-4">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Night came. The faint howl of a wild beast could be heard echoing in the distance. It seemed to be the cry of a wolf.
Nottie sat on her bed and lifted her long sleeves to reveal a bone-white armband carved in the fashion of a coiling
snake. The serpent's head was strikingly lifelike with its mouth stretched open to reveal its fangs. Its neck was reared
back as if ready to pounce on its prey the very next moment. The snake's slithering body was wrapped around her arm,
emitting a dangerous aura under the rays of the magical lamps that lit the room. &quot;Goodnight, my dear sister.&quot; Nottie
gently petted the armband, rubbing her pinkie playfully along the snake's tail. Shortly after, the magic lamps went out
and the entire room was draped in darkness.</p>
<p>The darkness of night brought Nottie boundless power. So Nottie was already wise to the unknown presence the moment it
entered the room. Sitting on the bed, Nottie could clearly see Dietrich as he quietly gathered her clothes and felt his
way around in the dark. It became harder and harder for Nottie to hold back her laughter, until Dietrich was just in
front of her.</p>
<p>Dietrich met the same dazzling eyes that occupied his mind all day. But her eyes were somehow different now. They were
no longer blue like water as Dietrich had seen that day. At this moment, they were filled with the night, devoid of
waves, tranquil like the depths of the sea.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, drink the water in this cup.&quot; That was the last thing Dietrich heard before his consciousness faded away.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-3"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-3">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>The cup fell from his languid hand as Dietrich collapsed to the floor. Nottie crouched beside Dietrich and relieved him
of the saber sheathed upon his waist. She stroked the hilt of the blade for a moment before pulling back her hand, and a
black gemstone that had been inlaid in the hilt fell into her palm.</p>
<p>&quot;How convenient... You brought the Eye of Eternal Night right to me. Thank you.&quot; Removing the snake armband as she
spoke, she placed the black gemstone in the mouth of the snake. Scales and flesh began to quickly ripple from the
snake's head down its body. A small black snake uncoiled in Nottie's hands, slithering off her palm and falling to the
floor. The snake began to enlarge, forming into a massive python with red eyes and black scales, its twisting body
almost filled the whole room. Nottie extended her hand as the magical lamps illuminated the room, the python began to
shrink down again and coiled back around her arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm? Are you hiding?&quot; Nottie turned her gaze to beneath the bed. Under which she found... A dog. It was trembling
uncontrollably, probably frightened by the python a moment before.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, what a pity. I wanted to turn you into a wolf, but it seems you turned into a dog instead!&quot; Although Nottie's words
seemed to be apologizing, her voice lacked any hint of remorse.</p>
<p>Dietrich still hadn't realized what happened yet. It was only by pure instinct that he had scurried under the bed. Only
then did he begin to come to his senses. He tried to say something after hearing Nottie's words, but no matter how hard
he tried, only &quot;woof woof woof&quot; would come out. After hearing himself, Dietrich panicked and dashed out from under the
bed.</p>
<p>No matter how many times Dietrich leaped in front of the mirror, or how many times he howled in disbelief, the
reflection of a striking young noble never appeared again. Dietrich then turned with a snarl and leaped towards Nottie.
Without even being the least bit startled, she simply glanced at him with folded arms. Suddenly Dietrich could no longer
move toward her, no matter how hard he tried.</p>
<p>&quot;That's not the proper etiquette for addressing a lady. Hmm... It seems you need to be trained!&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-5"><a class="header" href="#volume-5">Volume 5</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Allow me to introduce myself again. I am Nottfriga, but perhaps you're more familiar with my nickname. People call me
the Enchantress of the Night.&quot; As she spoke, her long golden hair began to gradually darken, eventually turning black as
the night sky outside the window. Her once sky-blue eyes were now pitch-black, ushering in the darkness of night.</p>
<p>&quot;I am your master now. Of course, I will need to train you well.&quot; Nottfriga knelt down and placed a necklace that
seemingly appeared out of nowhere on the still struggling Dietrich. The necklace shrank in size until it fit perfectly
around his furry neck. No matter how he thrashed head about or clawed at it, the necklace would not budge.</p>
<p>&quot;Tsk. We've already wasted so much time. Come, we're leaving.&quot; With that, Nottfriga set off towards the city. Dietrich
whimpered along the way with all the strength he could muster, wishing he could simply run back to his villa. But he
couldn't, no matter how hard he tried. The necklace Freya had placed on him seemed to control him, so he had no choice
but to follow behind her.</p>
<p>Nottfriga glanced back at the reluctant Dietrich dawdling behind herm and curled a strand of hair around her finger.
&quot;Although it is certainly amusing to watch you struggle in your current state, you are much too noisy. So unless you'd
like a taste of my new Silence of the Night spell, you'd better keep your yapping mouth shut.&quot; The whole world seemed to
fall into silence at that moment. Intuition told Dietrich that it'd be best not to become the latest test subject for
Freya's new spell.</p>
<h2 id="volume-6"><a class="header" href="#volume-6">Volume 6</a></h2>
<p>Dietrich witnessed the fall of the house of Lawrence. Who knew where Mother's kitty had gone. His father, driven to
distraction, and his mother, hysterical, were so close by, and yet no matter how he shouted, they did not pay him any
heed.</p>
<p>&quot;Arf...&quot; Dietrich lowered his head, but before he could speak again, the ground opened up beneath him. A pair of old
crone's hands stretched out from the ground, seizing him by the neck. Then he fell, and his fall seemed not to end, till
at last he crashed to earth at the feet of the old witch. Strangely, it hurt not at all.</p>
<p>Something hooked onto Dietrich's necklace, and he found himself hoisted up bodily. All before him was darkness, and he
could only see one thing — that which was below him. It was a steaming pot, filled with some unknown black substance
that gurgled and belched. There were some solids in there, too, and when he looked, he could espy spiderwebs and the
bones of venomous vipers... Into his ear crept Nottfriga's voice: &quot;Ah, I have you now, my last ingredient. Once I've put
you in, my stew of life eternal shall be complete. Hahaha!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Woof! Woof! Woof!&quot; Let me go, you dastardly witch! Dietrich struggled with all his might, not thinking for a moment
that the bond of the hitherto inescapable necklace would suddenly be so easily slipped— &quot;Ar—&quot; And so he fell... He heard
nothing more, naught else but the howling wind and Nottfriga's crazed laughter whipping about his ears.</p>
<h2 id="volume-7"><a class="header" href="#volume-7">Volume 7</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Wake up—&quot; Dietrich felt his body being rocked gently. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; A hand reached over as if to check his
breathing. It was a familiar voice... Gentle as the April breeze, and genial as the March sun.</p>
<p>Dietrich forced his eyes open, and before them— Was the golden-haired, blue-eyed girl. &quot;Ah, wonderful, you're finally
awake,&quot; she said with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;This place...Is this... Celestia?&quot; Dietrich wondered. &quot;No, I'm afraid it's just an ordinary forest,&quot; the girl replied.
Then Dietrich's senses returned to him, and he knew then the young lady before him was the source of all his troubles —
the wicked old witch, Nottfriga! In a flash, he had recovered, and leaping a distance away from her he maintained a
guarded stance.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. Ah, I must've forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Magdalene. I'm, well,
Nottfriga's younger sister.&quot; So saying, Magdalene gave the finger behind her back a twirl — a calming spell of light
magic, and she approached Dietrich. &quot;Come now, it's alright.&quot;</p>
<p>At this did Dietrich indeed calm down. He desired to ask the girl before him how she could understand him — but he could
still do naught but bark. &quot;Oh, this? It is but a small spell. My sister knows it too.&quot; &quot;Woof, woof, woof!?&quot; So that
crone did hear what I said, and simply pretended not to so she might string me along!? &quot;Well... Still, Nottfriga is
actually a gentle person.&quot; And speaking of her sister, Magdalene smiled gorgeously once more. &quot;...&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-8"><a class="header" href="#volume-8">Volume 8</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Do witches trade their brains for mighty magic? I can't get through to her at all...&quot; Dietrich thought to himself as he
followed the golden-haired maiden, who rambled on about something or another. &quot;Ah, don't say that! If my sister heard
you, she would be most angry.&quot; Magdalene said this in a quiet voice as she looked at Dietrich. &quot;Woof, woof, woof, woof?&quot;
Well, you needn't tell her, do you... Wait, how did you know what I was thinking? &quot;Ah... But. It. Is. Too. Late. Now.&quot;</p>
<p>Dietrich lifted his head in alarm at the rising pressure above him— Her expression had not changed at all... But even
so... He knew that the girl before him was now changed. &quot;It seems that your nightmare has been of some use — for your
memory, at least. But as I see it, you are still far from adequate.&quot; That proud, cold voice from on high — yes, surely
this was Nottfriga. &quot;well then, I suppose I shall leave the Essence of the Inmost Heart inside you.&quot;</p>
<p>What on earth was the &quot;Essence of the Inmost Heart&quot;... Wait, no. Magdalene had mentioned just such a thing. &quot;Don't
worry! The nightmare from before was a falsehood. My sister placed the Essence of the Inmost Heart into you, and it can
see your fears. That is why you dreamed of the things you fear most.&quot; &quot;But I think that my sister must've done it for
your good. She is, after all, a most gentle soul.&quot; ... Dietrich's fur stood on end, and he trembled as he peeked at
Nottfriga, banishing any other thoughts from his mind. &quot;Hah, it seems that my teachings have been quite useful indeed.
Well then, let us be on our way.&quot; Dietrich's frightened appearance pleased his master, the witch.</p>
<h2 id="volume-9"><a class="header" href="#volume-9">Volume 9</a></h2>
<p>At this moment, Magdalene was clutching a dog — indeed, this was Dietrich — as she kept up a leisurely pace. The
golden-haired maiden traipsed upon the gnarled roots of massive trees like an elegant swan, lithely making her way
through the woods.</p>
<p>&quot;How fortunate that she is currently Magdalene. If it were that hag Nottfriga, she would certainly make me walk or use
some sort of magic to force me to run. This path is not made for dogs — no, not even humans could traverse it. There
isn't even a road, only trees... Ah, it would be nice if Magdalene could keep carrying me like this...&quot; Dietrich's
thoughts meandered as he turned to look at Magdalene.</p>
<p>The morning light danced upon her face. She possessed a beauty that could not be considered lesser than any
noblewoman's. Her light complexion and gentle expression made her seem delicate, like the short-lived morning dew born
upon on flower petals. &quot;Magdalene's skin is so fair... I daresay none of the nobles I've met can compare to her,&quot;
Dietrich thought as he gazed upon the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me tell you a story. That is, I'm already dead,&quot; Magdalene suddenly spoke.</p>
<h2 id="volume-10"><a class="header" href="#volume-10">Volume 10</a></h2>
<p>A long time ago, there was a witch who gave birth to twin daughters. However, witches are unable to keep two offspring
from the same generation. That is the price they pay, the cost of their enormous power. But this witch had already
reached the apex of mastery in dark magic. She offered her own life force to preserve the life of her twins.</p>
<p>Still, this solution could not last forever, and as the last of the witch's life force faded, the day of their fated
farewell arrived at last. In death, the witch was finally freed from the world. The surviving elder sister, Nottfriga,
inherited everything, and felt entirely responsible for the passing of her younger sister, Magdalene. Luckily for
Nottfriga, she inherited the witch's talent for dark magic. Using herself as a vessel, she summoned Magdalene's soul
using complicated magical symbols and obscure incantations. Then, she read all of the leather-bound books in the tower,
and combining what she learned with dark magic and alchemy, created a new vessel. However, the ability to place her
sister's soul inside the vessel and bring her back to life was not only a forbidden art in light magic, it was also
exceptionally difficult — especially for Nottfriga, who knew no light magic whatsoever. Nevertheless, Nottfriga's
insistence on bringing Magdalene back spurred her on, and eventually she found a solution. She transformed the vessel
into a serpent bracelet that she wore on her wrist, and set out on an adventure.</p>
<p>&quot;My beloved sister, when this is all over, we will never be apart again...&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-11"><a class="header" href="#volume-11">Volume 11</a></h2>
<p>The last ray of light was fading, and darkness was about to engulf the forest. &quot;It's time to switch, my dear elder
sister.&quot; Suddenly, Magdalene put down Dietrich, whom she had been holding in her arms. &quot;One last thing, elder sister-I
have a present for you. I hope you like it.&quot; With this, light slowly began to shine from her fingers, gradually forming
a dazzling ball of light. This was Magdalene's light magic. &quot;Alright, from now on, you have to be well behaved. Shh,
don't say anything.&quot; &quot;What? Why are you being so mysterious... Ugh.&quot; Before Dietrich could react, he had quietly
muttered something, but his speech was interrupted when he suddenly found a slender hand tightly covering his mouth. A
moment later, the girl — now transformed — hastily stuffed something into his mouth. &quot;What's this...&quot; It was the hilt of
Dietrich's sword. The sword that once proudly hung from his belt. &quot;!?&quot; Dietrich opened his mouth instinctively to say
something.</p>
<p>&quot;Bite down on it if you want to live.&quot; Nottfriga raised one hand into the air, and Dietrich felt unable to breathe as
the collar around his neck grew tighter and tighter. Powerless to resist, it was all he could do to bite down as
instructed.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen carefully. In a moment, you will need to defend yourself with this sword. Even though you're an ignorant and
useless spoiled brat, it would still be a lot of trouble for me if you died here.&quot; Nottfriga raised Dietrich's head and
spoke in a low voice. &quot;After all, I haven't finished teaching you a lesson yet. It would ruin my fun if you died too
easily.&quot; The witch of the night finished speaking, and retracted her hand to adjust her garments. The collar loosened
again, returning to normal tightness. At once, air rushed passed his teeth and in through his nostrils, filling up his
lungs again. Dietrich still did not dare relax his jaw's grip on the sword, however, so he had to make do with somewhat
impaired breathing.</p>
<p>Before long, the sound of commotion was heard in the distance...</p>

<p>During the time of the aristocracy, the tyrants who ruled Mondstadt spurned the study of history and forbade the people
from speech and song that alluded to historical events. For they knew the extent of their own degeneracy, and wished not
for their deeds to be held to scrutiny by the annals of history alongside tales of heroes' honor and glory.</p>
<p>But the winds of history blow strong, and ultimately no wall could be built tall enough to stay them. This work is a
collection of all poems, songs, and legends that have survived from the aristocratic period, interspersed with
archaeologists' commentary. Its purpose is to provide a new account of Mondstadt's history from the Age of Kings all the
way through to the fall of the Aristocracy. A degree of historical inaccuracy is inevitable, given that certain details
are impossible to verify. We can but humbly hope that this work might elucidate the past for those who come after us, or
perhaps inspire them to further investigate the facts of history on their own.</p>
<p>This work is divided into three sections: Section 1, &quot;The Stormlord of the Tower and the Kingwolf of Boreas&quot; covers the
struggle between the Kings of Ice and Frost prior to Barbatos' arrival. Section 2, &quot;The Cultivation of Mondstadt,&quot;
covers Mondstadt's ancestors, including the aristocrats' predecessors, in the period during which agriculture developed.
Section 3, &quot;Tyrants, Heirs, and Rebels,&quot; covers the long rein of the Aristocracy in Mondstadt.</p>
<p>The reader may wish for this work to serve as a cautionary tale to future generations. In fact, it was compiled with
such ambition in mind. The freedom bestowed upon us by Barbatos is also the freedom that allows us to cast off the
shackles of the past in search of the truth. My only hope is that this work, in a spirit of openness and truth, may
finally share with the reader those stories which it was forbidden to share in the past.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="knights-of-favonius-handbook---5th-edition"><a class="header" href="#knights-of-favonius-handbook---5th-edition">Knights of Favonius Handbook - 5th Edition</a></h1>
<p>This handbook is a guide on the core principles of the Knights of Favonius. Knights should carefully read the contents
of this handbook and strictly hold themselves to the standards detailed within their life and work, serving the people
of Mondstadt as a model Knight of Favonius.</p>
<p>As members of the Knights of Favonius, it is incumbent upon us to be the very embodiment of the three virtues of
knighthood: modesty, honesty, and self-control. These are the three pillars of Mondstadt's freedom - remember, freedom
cannot exist without the support of duty.</p>
<p>The direct embodiment of these values comes, of course, in one's everyday speech and actions. Hence, this handbook
outlines behavioral standards and language usage prescriptions that are intended to cover all potential scenarios that
you may encounter in the course of duty.</p>
<p><strong>Section One</strong></p>
<p>A knight must exercise vigilance at all times and must never treat any potential threat to Mondstadt lightly. When it
comes to your attention that a citizen of Mondstadt in need, you must come to their aid promptly and willingly, for it
is the fundamental duty of the Knights of Favonius to be of service to the people of Mondstadt.</p>
<p><strong>Section Two</strong></p>
<p>When greeting a traveling merchant from a distant land, pay attention to express proper respect and courtesy. Do not
exhibit suspicion or hostility towards them, no matter how suspicious they may seem.</p>
<p>Approved Language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Welcome to Mondstadt, strange yet respectable traveler(s)/wayfarer(s)/guest(s)!* Please state your identity and
intended destination. The Knights of Favonius are here to ensure your safety.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*Select the appropriate term of address accordingly.</p>
<p>Prohibited Language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hey, you! Stop right there! State your identity, you rascal(s)/hooligan(s)/ruffian(s)/outlander(s)/trespasser(s)!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to the City of Wind and Song, otherworldly traveler(s)/vagrant animal(s)/burgeoning storm(s).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Refrain from using vulgar or coarse language. It is especially important never to address the guest using
pejorative nomenclature, for this is certain to make them feel most unwelcome indeed.</p>
<p><strong>Section Three</strong></p>
<p>Never meet members of the public with an attitude of nonchalance or apathy. A responsible knight must always be ready to
offer up both sword and sweat for the people's sake. Accordingly, during periods of rest, recreation, or relative
inactivity, you must maintain a knightly disposition and be ready to fully re-engage in work matters at a moment's
notice.</p>
<p>Approved Language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Musing to oneself while on a break) &quot;I shall check for any previously undiscovered safety issues in Mondstadt - for
I, as a knight, have a duty to safeguard Mondstadt at all times.&quot;</p>
<p>(Conversing with city folk at the tavern) &quot;As a knight, I am expected to gain an understanding of people's day-to-day
needs and concerns, this knowledge is also indispensable to me in the performance of my duties.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Even when there is no work to be done whatsoever, it is not permissible to take a gratuitous amount of down time
at your own discretion.</p>
<p>Prohibited Language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(On active guard duty) &quot;Imagine having a lifetime's supply of cider...&quot;</p>
<p>(While taking a break) &quot;Noeeeelle... Have you got a minute...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: The Acting Grand Master has instructed Noelle to immediately report any work-shy knights who attempt to delegate
their existing duties to her. It should go without saying that this behavior is entirely unacceptable. Penalties for
violations will take the form of reduced vacation allowance and/or salary deductions. The next time that you consider
shirking your duties, you are strongly advised to consider whether the consequences are worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Section Four</strong></p>
<p>While the Knights of Favonius respect the important place of wine in Mondstadt's cultural heritage, it is nevertheless
expected that knights will exercise due self-control with regard to their alcohol intake. It is not permitted to be
drunk while on duty, and it is strictly forbidden to encourage or facilitate the consumption of alcohol by minors.</p>
<p>Note: Knights of Favonius who are not of legal drinking age are forbidden from consuming alcohol. Accordingly, minors
must always be accompanied by an adult coworker when entering taverns and other premises where alcohol is served.</p>
<p><strong>Section Five (New)</strong></p>
<p>Owing to a recent increase in Fatui activity in the city, knights are reminded that it is forbidden to disclose details
of any matters concerning Knights of Favonius operations and strategic deployment to any persions from outside the
organization while not on active duty.</p>
<p><strong>Section Six</strong></p>
<p>In the event of a major Mondstadt-wide emergency, Knights of Favonius are expected to lead by example and act to
safeguard human lives and property. In times of crisis, when people come to you with questions, it is important to
answer them clearly and calmly, and to remind them to prioritize their personal safety at all times.</p>
<p>Approved Language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Please, do not worry. The Knights of Favonius will do their utmost to protect Mondstadt!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When danger is imminent, please do not panic. Cover your head with both hands, and crouch down to protect your vital
parts. Then, follow the instructions given to you by the Knights of Favonius crew, who will lead you to safety in a
swift and orderly fashion.&quot;</p>
<p>(New) &quot;Please rest assured that even though Grand Master Varka is not currently in Mondstadt, the Knights of Favonius
are quite well equipped to deal with this crisis in a swift and elegant manner.&quot;*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*Only applicable during the Grand Master's absence.</p>
<p>Prohibited Language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Uh-oh, we've never had to deal with a situation like this before...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even the knights are powerless in the face of a crisis of this magnitude...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Even in extreme cases where the crisis is indeed of a kind that has not been seen before, it is imperative that
you do not appear overwhelmed in front of members of the public, and that you do not do or say anything to call into
question the capabilities of the Knights of Favonius.</p>
<p><strong>Section Seven</strong></p>
<p>When greeting travelers from afar, please act hospitably by informing them of the locations of essential businesses and
services, recommending popular tourist destinations, and giving any further assistance that they may request or require.</p>
<p>Approved Language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If it's your first time here, I recommend visiting Mondstadt's Cathedral.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you're tired, go have some of Mondstadt's famous wine at a tavern called 'Angel's Share.'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Section Eight</strong></p>
<p>Remember to espouse the virtues of modesty and honesty also in your interactions with coworkers and companions. That is
to say, be self-effacing in conversation with comrades, and be open and truthful with them. Nurturing and maintaining a
sense of camaraderie and solidarity between all our knights is our first line of defense against the enemy.</p>
<p>Approved Language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That was wonderful! I've never had a battle experience like that before!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Avoid exaggerating your speech to the point where you become overbearing. Your words and tone should simply
express a sufficient degree of respect and cordiality towards your fellow knights.</p>
<p><strong>Section Nine</strong></p>
<p>As guardians of Mondstadt serving as the shield of the Anemo Archon, the Knights of Favonius must set an example for
others to follow. Under no circumstances should any knight ever violate the rules and regulations of Mondstadt. If any
knight is found to have damaged public property* (or the private property of a citizen of Mondstadt) while not on duty,
following a damage assessment, an amount equivalent to the damages caused shall be deducted from the salary and/or bonus
of the knight in question. Knights who are minors at the time of the violation, and who therefore do not receive a
formal salary, will be penalized with solitary confinement in lieu of a fine, with the period of incarceration to be
determined based on the severity of the violation.</p>
<p>*The fish and other aquatic life found in Mondstadt's lakes and rivers are classed as public property, and as such must
*not be destroyed under any circumstances!</p>
<p><strong>Section Ten</strong></p>
<p>Knights of Favonius should always remain vigilant and exercise due caution when dealing with strangers. Even when
dealing with non-hostiles, a knight should clarify to the stranger their rights and responsibilities as an outsider,
explaining the rules and customs of Mondstadt in a firm but fair manner.</p>
<p>(Amendment 1) Extra scrutiny is required when dealing with visiting diplomats from other nations whose activity gives
cause for concern.</p>
<p><strong>Section Eleven</strong></p>
<p>In the interests of preventing incidents involving wind glider users, Knights of Favonius should also pay close
attention to aerial activity in the region. Knights are required to perform spot-checks on users of wind gliders and
ensure that the details therein are current and valid. Should you observe any illegal aerial activity with the city, you
should shout to the offender at the top of your voice, imploring them to cease gliding immediately. Should they persist,
you should take such further action as is necessary to deescalate the situation.</p>
<p>Note: Even if the airborne offender is an off-duty member of the Knights of Favonius, this is no cause for leniency. You
have full authority to revoke the offending party's gliding license should you deem this to be appropriate course of
action.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix: Terminology Notes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Knightly virtues</p>
<p>Refers to the three core virtues of modesty, honesty, and self-control espoused by the Knights of Favonius. The three
are mutually reinforcing and treated as a collective. Knights must conduct themselves in accordance with these
virtues at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terms of address</p>
<p>Refers to the various honorifics used to address members of the public, including visitors to Mondstadt. As public
servants to the free people of Mondstadt and hosts to others from beyond our borders, we are expected to use the
appropriate terms of address in all encounters as an act of courtesy. An education in etiquette is mandatory for all
serving knights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duty</p>
<p>Refers to our responsibilities to serve the people of Mondstadt and protect the freedom of Mondstadt. Officially
appointed Knights of Favonius should refrain from talking flippantly or irreverently about their responsibilities or
their honor as a knight in their day-to-day lives, so as to preserve the dignity of our organization's reputation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Anemo Archon (New)</p>
<p>The Anemo Archon Barbatos is the God of Wind and Song, the granter and guardian of Mondstadt's freedom, and the one
in whom the people of this land place their faith. As an organization, the Knights of Favonius heeds the will of the
Anemo Archon. This means that we must be prepared to go to war in the event that Mondstadt's freedom comes under
threat.</p>
<p>Note: Need to add additional material on this term. Several members of the Knights of Favonius and even the Church
seem not to have any belief in the Anemo Archon at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fatui</p>
<p>Diplomats and other agents of Snezhnaya stationed here in Mondstadt. They are afforded diplomatic immunity within our
borders. Their activities are shrouded in mystery and deceit, and their intentions are obscure.</p>
<p>Warning: Always be wary around members of the Fatui. If you observe any suspicious activity, report it to
headquarters immediately while taking care to prioritize your personal safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Abyss Order</p>
<p>An ancient, mysterious group of enemies from the abyss. No one knows how they came to be or what they seek.
Occasionally, they can be spotted causing trouble near Mondstadt.</p>
<p>Warning: Members of the Abyss Order are highly dangerous enemies. If you encounter one, exercise extreme caution and
report its location and activity to headquarters as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stormterror's Lair (New)</p>
<p>Refers to the ruins that lie to the northwest of Mondstadt. Legend holds that this area was once a city where a
tyrant ruled from his tower. It has since been occupied by Dvalin, who shelters himself there. For this reason, these
ruins have now been named &quot;Stormterror's Lair.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Thanks to help from Venerare and... I was finally able to get across... and make it to this mountain peak...</p>
<p>The peak is the tallest around, and the most dangerous. Forgive my lack of a more poetic description, but from its
appearance it would be apt to name it something like &quot;Pilos Peak.&quot; But after a simple survey of the terrain, I found
that maybe I could use a rope and stakes to climb up from the east face, then use the wind to throw a hook to... and
then...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>None of the young folks were willing to join me in climbing this mountain. Some were originally eager to give it a try,
but were scared off the idea by the older adventurers. &quot;It is a nightmare from which you cannot awaken,&quot; they would all
say. The failures of those who came before them turned their hearts old before their time, and weakened their resolve.
But I am not old yet. My body and mind are in perfectly good shape, and Pilos Peak is just the next mountain on my list
of challenges to conquer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Good news! Alrik has agreed to climb the mountain with me. I knew I'd find a kindred spirit eventually!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I really underestimated this mountain. Not until I tried to climb it did I realize, there is really no way up. It is
like some sort of mysterious gemstone, carved to perfection, flawlessly smooth, stood there towering in all its glory...
I hope the food supplies that the tribe furnished me with will be sufficient to see me to the top.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Another injury. My leg is in a very bad shape, and I have two frostbitten fingers on my left hand. At least my right
hand is intact. I think it will take me months to recover fully, but now is not the time to give up.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Bad news. Today, Alrik met his limit. He was too old, and he physically could not cope with the bitterly cold snowstorms
and the relentlessly steep terrain this far up the mountain. I held a brief funeral for him, and buried a bottle of his
favorite wine alongside him. Just me left now. The blizzard shows no sign of stopping, so I must continue my climb while
I can, lest the rocks freeze over...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I broke my leg again, but fortunately it was just a minor fracture. I barely escaped being blown into oblivion by a
barrage of hailstones from this blizzard. Somehow, I avoided certain death by clinging for dear life to some sharp rocks
and finally clawing my way back onto the cliff face. With much difficulty, I think I have found a way down the
mountain... If I had been thrown against that wall of ice or become trapped in a crevice, I fear that my luck would have
run out... This time it has opened an old wound. I am afraid I will not be able to climb for at least a year after
this...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The sky is so blue. I do not expect another snowstorm for at least a few days. I saw a falcon flying straight up into
the clouds, very close to the peak of the mountain — the place so high up that I cannot reach it.</p>
<p>If only I could soar into the sky, just like that falcon...</p>
<p>Just like the baby eagles from the fairy tale, who learned to fly at the summit of a tall mountain...</p>
<p>...</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-7"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-7">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>In the myths of ages past, every living being in this world had its own kingdom. Mondstadt was a forest in that age, a
playground of the boars. In the forest was the Boar Kingdom, where everybody lived happily under the reign of the Boar
King. The King had a lovely young daughter, who had the prettiest snout, the whitest tusks, and the smoothest fur in the
whole kingdom. The Boar Princess, beautiful and kind, gave the juiciest and sweetest fruits to her subjects every day.
From sweet and sour berries, to crisp apples, to delicious tree mushrooms, the Boar Princess always shared her
delicacies first with her friends. Every boar in the kingdom adored their King and Princess, and every day they praised
them so: &quot;Oink, oink! Bless our King! As long as he reigns over us, we will never starve!&quot; &quot;Oink, oink, Bless the gentle
Anemo Archon for giving our King such a kind and polite Princess!&quot;</p>
<p>(There are some words in the margin written in tiny handwriting: &quot;dada, if I dont eat candy efery night, and i pray
eferyday, will i turn into a wild piggy? i want to be a wild piggy because they are so tasty&quot;)</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-7"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-7">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>North of the boar forest was a frozen tundra. The playful Barbatos had not reached those lands, so they remained covered
by ice and snow. Every creature who ventured there risked freezing their paws and hooves off. &quot;It's cold, too cold! It's
freezing! My claws are going to shatter!&quot; Even the bravest, strongest Boar King could not withstand the frigid tundra.
&quot;Oink, oink, oink! My frozen snout is turning purple!&quot; There lived but a single lone wolf pup in that place.</p>
<p>(The childish handwriting at the bottom of the page reads: &quot;dada, why does the little doggy have paws that don't freeze
off in the cold?&quot;)</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-5"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-5">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>The pup was a carefree child who had bright blue eyes and slick gray fur. When he got angry, he looked exactly like the
wolf head relief atop the Mondstadt Cathedral. But one day, when he was hunting in the forest, he ran into the evil
squirrel sorcerer Woobakwa! Of all the beings in the ancient world, none were more evil than Woobakwa — not even demons
and dragons. Woobakwa despised everything nice, and swore to transform beauty into ugliness and turn light into dark. At
the sight of the joyful wolf, anger boiled inside him. He cursed: &quot;Squeak! Squeak! Angry am I! I shall spike his heart
with the coldest ice, and he will never again know the meaning of hope!&quot; With that said, Woobakwa began to curse the pup
with his magic. But the rash pup gobbled him up, just like that, without the slightest warning. Woobakwa was so furious
that he cursed the pup using the most foul and insulting words ever uttered by a squirrel. The pup felt the noise coming
from his mouth, and only then did he realize his mistake. &quot;Aroo, I'm so sorry, mister squirrel, I thought you were
edible!&quot; The pup wished to apologize to the squirrel, but he felt his throat tighten and then loosen. The squirrel slid
down to his stomach with a gulp.</p>
<p>(A sheet of paper bearing fine handwriting is taped to this page: &quot;Lily, this is why you should eat cautiously when
you're outside.&quot;)</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-4"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-4">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>No one knew just what chemical reaction occurred in the pup's stomach, but Woobakwa's curse magically came into effect!
Because of the curse, the pup's heart was pierced and frozen by an icicle. The pup became cold and mean forever after,
and whenever other animals showed kindness to him, he would repay them with the harshest of words or the most woeful of
deeds. In the end, every animal loathed him. From then on, every wolf in the forest spoke of the pup in this way: &quot;Woof,
what a selfish wolf he is! Such an obnoxious kid.&quot; &quot;Woof, woof, what a heartless wolf he is! Let us stay away from him.&quot;
One by one, the pup lost all his friends. The forest welcomed the lonely pup no more, so he had no choice but to head
north. The blizzards that blew in the northern tundra kept most creatures away. But with his heart already frozen solid,
the pup was no longer afraid of the cold. He decided to settle down there, and became the lone wolf that roamed the
tundra</p>
<p>(A young girl has written in the corner of the page: &quot;Dada, but where did Woobakwa go?&quot;)</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-1">Volume 5</a></h2>
<p>One day, the Boar Princess heard about the pup and was deeply saddened by his story. So she asked her people about how
to defrost his heart and turn him back to his former sweet self. She asked and asked, but only the wise fox and the
elderly turtle knew the answer: &quot;Ack-ack-ack! Only sincerity and fire could melt such evil ice. Ack-ack-ack!&quot; The fox
replied. &quot;Friendship demands sacrifice. No friendships come without sacrifices. I apologize for not knowing how to make
funny sounds,&quot; the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle said. The clever Boar Princess knew right away what she had to do. She
dried her tears and curtsied to the two wise animals: &quot;Oink oink! Thank you! I would like you to go see the pup with me,
so you could be the first to witness our friendship!&quot; When the fox and the turtle heard the Boar Princess was willing to
invite them on a royal trip, their hearts were full of joy. They set out with the Princess and headed north.</p>
<p>(A handwritten note, seemingly from the young girl's father, is taped to the page: &quot;Turtles can't make noises, no matter
how hard they try. The reason Grandpa Turtle apologizes for this is just because he is very polite.&quot;)</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-1">Volume 6</a></h2>
<p>And so, the Princess and her two wise companions arrived in the snowswept hinterland of the far north. Ice and snow
covered the land as far as the eye could see. Neither the biggest, bravest animals nor even the weasel, who is the most
skilled digger of them all, could find so much as a single blade of soft grass or a single piece of juicy fruit.</p>
<p>The Princess was shivering from head to tail in the freezing cold, yet she was undaunted. Without even looking back, she
pressed on deeper into the frozen wasteland. The wise fox and the trustworthy turtle could not bear the piercing wind
and the freezing snow. They begged of the Princess:</p>
<p>&quot;Ack-ack-ack! If His Majesty the King knew that you were adventuring to such a cold and dangerous place as this, he
would be very worried! Let's head back home... Ack-ack-ack,&quot; exclaimed the fox. &quot;Yes, I agree! I fear the snowstorm will
get stronger and colder with each passing second... Let us at least rest a while, and continue our journey once the wind
has stopped and the sun is out? Once again, I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds,&quot; reasoned the turtle.</p>
<p>It was to no avail. The persevering Princess did not heed the advice of her wise companions, but insisted that they
continue to press on into the bitter cold of the far north. For what nobler cause could one pursue in this world than
rescuing lost kin and rekindling lost friendships?</p>
<p>Onwards they continued through the ice and snow, until their paws and hooves were purple from the cold, until each
breath they exhaled turned into ice which became one with the swirling blizzard around them. Then, at the icy peak of a
tall mountain, next to a frozen river which, in spite of everything, still flowed — albeit with icicles rather than
water — the Princess met a spirit, swaying to and fro in the freezing wind.</p>
<p>An ancient race of wise spirits lived atop that ice-capped mountain. They had no physical form, but possessed great
magical power. &quot;Oink oink! Are you the master of this place? Please, O Spirit, could you guide us through this
snowstorm?&quot; The Princess politely posed her question as her hooves, now numb from the cold, trembled in the snow. The
wise fox and the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle also looked expectantly at the spirit of the snowstorm. As they gazed, their
paws and flippers, respectively, numb from the cold, trembled in the snow.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoosh, whoosh...&quot; The spirit of the snowstorm spoke softly. &quot;Of course, but... whoosh, whoosh...&quot; &quot;In return, I will
sap your energy. The further forward you go in the storm, the more tired and hungry you will become — though I assure
you, it will not be life threatening... I hope... Whoosh, whoosh...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oink oink! This is, after all, the spirit of the snowstorm,&quot; pondered the Princess. &quot;And I am also in the company of
the two wisest, most caring members of my family. Whatever may happen, they will always be able to find a way!&quot; Without
a moment's hesitation, the Princess granted the spirit of the snowstorm her request. The wise fox and the trustworthy
Grandpa Turtle had no time at all to formulate, let alone articulate, any remonstration.</p>
<p>&quot;Oink oink, I do declare this deal a fair one! Now, lead us to the wolf pup!&quot; And so, the spirit turned into an ice
stream, and carried the persevering Princess over the tall mountain...</p>
<h2 id="volume-7-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-7-1">Volume 7</a></h2>
<p>After venturing through the bitter cold and the swirling storms, the Boar Princess finally met the pup. The pup was
covered in ice. His once bright blue eyes had grown dim, and he had all but forgotten how to bark. &quot;Aroo! You have come
at the right moment, for I haven't had lunch yet!&quot; Hearing his words, the kind Boar Princess could not help but shed
tears. Her warm tears seemed to melt a little of the ice at the tip of the pup's heart. &quot;Aroo! Why are you crying?&quot;
&quot;Oink, oink! You are going to starve out here — I have never seen such misery in my kingdom!&quot; &quot;I will sacrifice
everything to feed your hungry belly!&quot; The pup was stupefied by her words. &quot;Arooooooo! Miss, you must be mad! No one has
ever dared say such things to me!&quot; But when the pup saw the determination in her eyes, his frozen heart melted some
more. &quot;Nope! That's why...&quot; &quot;I will sacrifice two of the wisest and most caring members of my family just to feed you!
It is for the sake of our friendship!&quot; The fox knew what horror she meant and attempted to run, but he was pinned to the
ground by the pup and the Boar Princess. Grandpa Turtle was so frightened by the sight that he retreated into his shell.
The pup and the Boar Princess enjoyed a delicious appetizer of fox out in the snow. Next, they found a cave, picked a
few mushrooms, built a fire with some moss, and treated themselves to a tasty turtle soup. The pup felt the delight of
sharing and making friends for the first time he could remember. His frozen heart melted completely, and he shed tears
of joy. The Princess took the pup by his paw, and the two merrily returned to their home.</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-8"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-8">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Dandelion, dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land.&quot; The little fox chanted. He blew the dandelion flower and sent
the seeds flying. He then spoke in a more serious tone. &quot;May my teacher's wishes ride the wind and reach the Anemo
Archon.&quot; A wind blew past us and swept away the dandelion seeds. Did they fly to a better place, carrying my hopes and
dreams there with them?</p>
<p>When did this happen? Some time ago, behind the village, there grew a forest of countless lush trees. At the center of
this forest was a small lake. The lake was like the stained glass windows of the Mondstadt Cathedral: crystal clear and
shimmering in the sunlight. The sun shone through the treetops and glistened on the water's surface like fragments of
gemstones. It was really something. The weather was cool that day. I was hunting in the forest when I arrived at the
lake's edge. The shimmering water somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago. I couldn't remember much about
her, but I felt that her eyes must have looked like the lake, glittering as if harboring fragments of gemstones within.
I became lost in thought as I stared at the glistening water. Walking transfixed along the lakeside, I had forgotten
entirely that I was out for a hunt. I came to when I heard the sound of something freezing up. It was a Mist Flower
growing by the lake, having just frozen the water around it. Next to it was a white fox, its tail frozen in the ice.
Poor critter. &quot;It must have had its tail in the water by the Mist Flower while it was drinking.&quot; Mist Flowers are
dangerous plants and can cause frostbite if handled without care. Extreme caution must be taken when handling them. As
it saw me approach, the fox struggled in fear, but its still-frozen tail kept it rooted to the spot. The fox whimpered
in pain. &quot;Oh no, this won't do.&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Poor critter. It's gonna die anyway if I don't save it, so I
might as well end its pain by bringing it home as my game for the day.&quot; I imagined what a delicious fox stew I could
cook with the carrots I grew. Just thinking of the hot stew gave me energy and brought a smile to my face. So I took out
my hunting bow and slowly walked toward it. &quot;Be good and stay put.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-8"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-8">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Be good and stay put.&quot; That's what my father's father had taught me. When I went fox hunting, I always chanted his
words silently, so that my hands wouldn't shake when pulling the bowstring. But just as I was about to release the
arrow, the fox lifted its head and looked me straight in the eyes. It had eyes like the lake, glistening as if harboring
fragments of gemstone within. My head began spinning, as if a strong wind were blowing inside it. My arrow missed its
target and instead smashed the ice, releasing the fox's tail. The fox raised its tail and looked at me once more before
running off into the forest. I came to my senses and began the chase — but who in this world can run faster than a fox?
Gradually, the fox began to shrink into the distance, eventually turning into a white spot. &quot;Hey! Don't go!&quot; I shouted,
barely catching my breath. After hearing my words, the spot seemed to slow. &quot;Is it waiting for me?&quot; I pondered. &quot;If
running for its life, a fox is able to shake off anyone in no time.&quot; Foxes are strange animals. Even when running on a
flat plain like at Windrise, where one can see clearly for miles ahead, they somehow still seem to disappear from view.
It's almost as if they run into another world. This led me to my conclusion: &quot;The fox must be waiting for me!&quot; Convinced
of this fact, I chased the glittering white spot for hours on end. Suddenly, a chilling wind began to blow. I stood
there, shivering, and what I saw next astounded me. &quot;How can this be?&quot; Suddenly, instead of one, there were now two
white spots in view. More appeared. Three, four, five... They seemed to grow in number as the winds blew. Eventually, I
lost track. Suddenly, with a stinging sensation, one of them flew directly into my eye. Upon inspection, I discovered
that the spots were in fact nothing more than dandelion seeds floating in the wind. The fox had disappeared. I laughed
at my own foolishness and went home. For supper, I had carrot fox stew — though without fox, or any other meat for that
matter. The gods know how much I hate boiled carrots without meat! I felt starving, and in time fell asleep. I awoke in
the middle of the night to something stirring outside my door.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-6"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-6">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Having failed to catch the fox, I went to sleep with only tasteless boiled carrots in my stomach. If not for what
happened next, I would have forgotten about the fox by now. I awoke with a start to strange noises coming from outside
my door. &quot;Perhaps boars have come to eat my carrots?&quot; I hopped out of bed and opened my door. To my surprise, there
stood a tiny little white fox. Its fur was so white that it glowed in the dark, not unlike the way the sunlight sparkles
on the water after filtering through the treetops. &quot;It must be that fox from earlier today!&quot; I thought again of those
eyes that looked like gemstones in the water, gazing at me as if from the depths of my heart. And so I walked over to
the fox, unarmed and with tired eyes. This time it stayed still and waited for me in silence. The closer I drew, the
greater in stature it became. By the time I stood before it, it had magically transformed into a human. She was a tall
and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water —
in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops. &quot;What a
beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell
me she must be her.&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;This can't be. Must be some type of fox magic.&quot; Stranger still, the idea of
&quot;fox magic&quot; had only occurred to me in that instant. You'd believe anything after you'd seen those eyes. For all the
magic and transformation I had witnessed, nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a
while, we stood silently in the dead of night. And at last she spoke. Though not in our common tongue, I could somehow
understand her. Some other magic, perhaps. &quot;I would have died by the lake, if you had not come in my hour of need.&quot; She
paused and continued: &quot;Although to die by that gemstone lake is no bad thing,&quot; &quot;We foxes are grateful beings, so you
must let me return the favor.&quot; She bowed to me, and her long silky black hair flowed down her shoulders like streams.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-5"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-5">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>For the next few days after that night, the fox never came again. But in those few days, prey in the forest became
gradually more abundant. Everything from small finches, long-legged cranes, and even scurrying boars... Maybe it was due
to the change in season, or maybe it was some sort of reparation from the fox. In any case, real stew had been served on
the table these last few days. But the fox never came again. As strange as it may seem, it had honestly been easier to
sleep hungry. Even with a full, satisfied stomach, I couldn't help but think about the day we met, and the woman that
the fox had turned into... When would I gaze upon her eyes again, glittering... like water in a lake. Lying half-asleep
with a heart full of turmoil, I heard a faint sound outside my door. I hopped from the bed and swung open the door,
eager to see a small white silhouette awaiting me. But there were no lake-blue eyes, and there was no fluffy white
foxtail. Instead, all I could see was dandelion seeds drifting in the white moonlight, floating like snowflakes in the
air. Suddenly, something got caught in my nostrils. &quot;Ah-Ahchooo!!!&quot; Immediately, the fluffy white dandelion seeds began
to swirl, filling the sky like a snowstorm. Amidst the flurry of dandelion seeds, a pair of jewel-like eyes were looking
at me, staring straight into my heart. Waving away the dandelions swirling about, I started walking towards the small
fox. The fox raised its ears and its furry tail flitted across the grass as it turned and disappeared into the depths of
the forest. I hurried and followed closely behind. In amongst the darkness of the trees, soft patches of white could be
seen weaving between the shadows. Their silhouettes tip-toed like moonlight cast among the tree leaves, or like the
hesitant strides of a crafty Seelie. With unfaltering trust, I followed the fox round and about, soon emerging from the
dark forest in a seemingly faraway land. There, in the moonlight, a sea of dandelions lay before me, stretching as far
as my eyes could see. Stunned by the sight, I then noticed a rustling noise coming from just behind me. It was a light,
delicate sound. Like that of a girl walking barefoot across pine needles and leaves on the ground. The fox approached me
from behind. The night air ferried her presence, cool and damp, whisked together with the slightly bitter fragrance of
dandelion flowers. Two hands with long, ice-cold fingers rested upon my shoulders. Then, she leaned close to my ear and
her long hair draped down over my shoulder. I could feel the pulse of her heartbeat and the soft rhythm her faint
breathe. It made me feel calm and at ease. &quot;Only the foxes know the way to this place. It is the homeland of the
dandelions. It is my desire that you would tarry here, and teach my child human language... In return, I will teach you
the magic of foxes.&quot; There was a tickle in my ear, as if one of the dandelion seeds grazed my ear as it was carried off
in the warm night breeze. Strange. I had clearly never mentioned anything about &quot;fox magic&quot; to her before. How could she
have known? With no reply, she took my hand and led me into the plush depths of the sea of dandelions. The night breeze
from the south, as well as the breeze from the north, both carried the bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers and faded
memories... She led me to gently frolic through the velvety white fields of dandelions, until the moon rose high in the
starry sky.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-2"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-2">Volume 5</a></h2>
<p>In a boundless sea of dandelions that existed in the middle of nowhere, I watched as the dandelion seeds took off at the
softest touch of a breeze. Suddenly, I knew the answer to that question that had been lingering on my mind for years.
&quot;So all the foxes that disappear during the hunt, this is where they hide away.&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;What a beautiful
place.&quot; But when I began teaching the little fox to speak our common tongue, my heart always felt empty, like a wind was
blowing inside of me. When we talked, I would look into her gemstone-lake eyes. In those moments I felt like I was
speaking not to the fox, but to a girl I used to love many years ago. And so, when she was around me, it was as if I
were in the presence of the child of someone I had once loved: We had an enjoyable time together, but the experience was
somehow tinged with sadness. But the thought of her promise — if I succeeded in teaching her child to speak the common
tongue... &quot;I shall impart the magic of transformation to you when the time comes.&quot; Remembering the way she made that
solemn promise to me... I knew she was serious, and that gave me determination. Could I transform into a flying bird
once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the
chance to go to Musk Reef. &quot;I could even use magic to hunt!&quot; I couldn't contain my excitement. &quot;No more meatless carrot
stews for me...&quot; I lost track of how long I stayed in the dandelion sea, where everything sways gently with the wind.
One reason was that the little one was such a fast learner! I taught him not only our language, but everything I knew in
one package, including how to count, how to grow carrots, how to change window panes, and how to sharpen knives. When it
came to rest, we would talk idly. &quot;Why must you learn human speach?&quot; He answered swiftly: &quot;So that when I transform into
a human, I can befriend them!&quot; I continued: &quot;Why would you want to befriend the humans?&quot; He dropped his gaze.</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-2"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-2">Volume 6</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Why must you learn human speech?&quot; On one occasion I asked the little fox this question. He answered cheerfully in the
common tongue: &quot;So that when I transform into a human, I can befriend them!&quot; &quot;Why would you want to befriend the
humans?&quot; This seemed to make him sad, and he dropped his gaze. &quot;I saw a boy in the distant forest.&quot; &quot;He was dressed in
grey. He looked and had eyes like a wolf,&quot; he added. &quot;I had just mastered my magic, and was running around excitedly on
my hind legs. Running on the grass was fun! But sadly, due to the difference in height, a fox can't see or smell the
same things that a human can.&quot; &quot;I'm sure you can guess what happened next, teacher! Suddenly, I realized a horrible
truth — I was lost.&quot; There was pain in his voice as he relayed the events of that day. In the end, he had wandered into
some faraway wood, and encountered vicious monsters. Just when he thought he was done for, that grey lupine boy suddenly
leaped out of the forest and chased away the monsters. Without a word, he turned around and vanished into the woods. &quot;If
I could transform into a human and speak their language, I could track him down and make friends with him!&quot; He said
gleefully. I couldn't help but ask when I heard his reply: &quot;Am I not your friend?&quot; The little fox answered sincerely in
the common tongue: &quot;Mommy told me that it's difference because you're my teacher — but I'd only hurt you if I tell you
that.&quot; He tilted his head in befuddlement. His fluffy tail patted the surrounding dandelions as he pondered over this
difficult issue. &quot;I know!&quot; He burst out. &quot;If I know something that you don't, that would make me your teacher.&quot; &quot;If we
are both teachers, that would make us equals — then we can be friends!&quot; Still unfamiliar with the common language, he
did his best to get the sentence out quickly. &quot;Teacher, please allow me to teach you some magic that only I know.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-7-2"><a class="header" href="#volume-7-2">Volume 7</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Teacher, please allow me to teach you some magic that only I know.&quot; Still unfamiliar with the common language, he did
his best to get the sentence out quickly, eager to befriend me. He picked a little dandelion. &quot;Dandelion, dandelion,
ride the wind to a faraway land.&quot; The little fox chanted. He blew the dandelion flower and sent the seeds flying. He
then spoke in a more serious tone. &quot;May my teacher's wishes ride the wind and reach the Anemo Archon.&quot; A wind blew past
us and swept away the dandelion seeds. &quot;See? The Anemo Archon has just answered my wish!&quot; He exclaimed merrily. &quot;What
wish did you make?&quot; &quot;To become friends with my teacher.&quot; He lowered his head abruptly. &quot;It must have been tiring to
teach him to speak your language. Our mouths are structured differently from a human's, so I must thank you for your
effort.&quot; We had not noticed the mother fox approaching. Her eyes were like bottomless lakes, and the little fox quietly
hid himself among the dandelions to escape her gaze. &quot;When he has mastered human language,&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;When
he has mastered human language,&quot; She said softly.</p>
<h2 id="volume-8-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-8-1">Volume 8</a></h2>
<p>&quot;When he has mastered human language...&quot; Thus she softly said. I looked at her face, mesmerized. I couldn't hear what
she said after that. The mischievous night breeze was laden with dandelion seeds, which muffled her words. Or perhaps
that was her native language? The language of dandelions? She began to laugh as she perceived my clumsy, gauche
appearance. She had the most beautiful laugh. The curved pupils in her eyes glistened like two crescent moons shining on
ripples in the lake. &quot;Now, tell me then, why is it you wish to learn fox magic?&quot; &quot;I want to learn to transform just like
foxes do. That way I could turn into a bird and fly to the highest of heights, and behold places that were once too far
for my eyes to see.&quot; That was my reply. &quot;Ahh yes, no longer will I need to lie in wait among the bushes while hunting.
Instead, I will be able to freely soar high above like a falcon.&quot; Thus I kept thinking to myself. As I was thought to
myself, the dandelion seed in my hand began to float up towards the moonlight, almost as if it had heard my thoughts. &quot;I
see...&quot; She lowered her head slightly and her long, black hair flowed down her neck like a waterfall, glistening in the
moonlight. Her pale white skin shone brightly, seemingly reflecting the wisps of clouds in the night sky above. I
couldn't take my eyes off her. After a moment, I quickly turned my gaze away as I started blushing again. Foxes are free
animals. They would never cover their beauty because of shame like humans do. Although this certainly wasn't the first
time I beheld her, every time the moonlight shone upon her long hair, I couldn't help but blush and look away. She
turned her face in thought for a moment, and let out a gentle sigh. She seemed rather displeased. We sat amidst the
dandelion sea, not saying a word. A long time passed, long enough that I started thinking that she might be angry with
me. &quot;We foxes are grateful beings. I will teach you the magic of transformation, and so fulfill your wish.&quot; The fox
said, turning her face towards me. Her lake-blue eyes shone in the moonlight, and it made me feel at peace. Thank
goodness, she wasn't mad at me. For some reason I could not clearly name, I quietly heaved a sight of relief.</p>
<h2 id="volume-9-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-9-1">Volume 9</a></h2>
<p>Foxes are clever animals. Clever and cunning. The little fox learned very quickly, and could sometimes even ask
questions that would stump me. For human speech is complicated and intricate, nothing like the innocence of animal
speech. Sometimes, language is like a yarn ball caught in the paws of a cat. It catches here and there, and there again
it catches a student's tongue, sometimes even tripping a teacher up. But foxes are clever animals, and very quickly they
learn the many intricacies of human speech that were handed down over the generations, becoming able to describe the way
dandelions float away, or how the moonlight shines over the lake in a rudimentary manner. Every time the little fox
discovered a new term, every time he tried using unfamiliar words to explore a familiar world, to bestow meanings upon
the wind, dandelions and the earth, she would be beside him, smiling, watching us. The little fox learned very quickly,
but I did not take much joy from that. When I had run out of things to teach, would she still keep me here in this
dandelion sea? When that time came, would I still be able to behold those beautiful eyes under the moonlight? Would she
still lead me into the depths of the dandelion sea, smiling slyly as we frolicked and breathed in the bitter fragrance
that came from both the north and south winds? As I thought about such things, I became lost in sullen memory. Yes,
that's right. On that night that I could no longer remember clearly, when I was about to part with the girl I loved,
this same moon had hung in the sky as well. &quot;Thank you for everything up till now.&quot; Before I knew it, the fox had walked
in front of me. She bowed, and her hair spilled over her shoulders, flowing like water in the glimmering moonlight.
&quot;Once he has learned human speech, he should be able to make more new friends.&quot; &quot;I am truly thankful to you for all
you've done. He has also cheered up significantly since beginning to learn the human language.&quot; She gazed at me, her
deep, unfathomable eyes shining like jewels. &quot;Still, once you have finished teaching us the human language, where will
you go then?&quot; Enraptured by those shining eyes, I forgot to reply. Was this fox magic, too? Seeing my wooden expression,
the fox laughed and sighed. Then, she turned and began walking in the direction of the moon, leading me further into the
center of the moonlit dandelion sea. Seeing this, the little fox swished its tail from side to side, and burrowed into
the dandelion fields.</p>
<h2 id="volume-10-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-10-1">Volume 10</a></h2>
<p>The little fox kept waving back to us as he walked. His figure grew smaller and smaller until it became a tiny white
spot, which blended into the dandelion sea and slowly faded away. After he had gone, the mother fox turned and walked to
me. The closer she drew, the greater in stature she became. By the time she stood before me, she had transformed into a
human. She was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone
fragments in pools of water — in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering
through the treetops. &quot;What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely
remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her.&quot; I thought to myself. For all the magic and transformation I had
witnessed, still nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in
the dandelion sea. At last, I could no longer contain myself, and opened my mouth: &quot;Is this the magic you wanted to
teach me? The magic of transformation?&quot; &quot;It is. I am most grateful for all your help over this long period.&quot; She bowed
to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams. Although saying farewell to the little fox
left emptiness in my heart, I soon became exhilarated at the thought of the transformation magic that I was about to
learn. Could I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could
transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef. &quot;I could even use magic to hunt!&quot; I couldn't
contain my excitement. &quot;No more meatless carrot stews for me...&quot; &quot;Then I shall ask you to stand still.&quot; She walked
circles around me, her body growing in size with each pass. No, not just her. The dandelions were also growing in size!
They had only been at my ankles when she started, but now stretched to over my waist, growing as if turning into
towering trees. It was only when I started to feel strange that I realized that the fox had become a giant.</p>
<h2 id="volume-11-1"><a class="header" href="#volume-11-1">Volume 11</a></h2>
<p>I started to feel strange, and then I noticed — I had turned into a dandelion! Even if I wanted to protest, the
dandelion had no mouth nor tongue for me to make a sound. All I could do was watch helplessly as the giant gently picked
the dandelion plant from the ground and held it between her thumb and index finger. &quot;Dandelion, dandelion, ride the wind
to a faraway land.&quot; The fox chanted. And then with a puff, the dandelion seeds began to dance in the air. I was caught
in a storm and whisked away to a distant sky. The swirling made my head dizzy. Those eyes that glistened like gemstones
in the lake had left me, along with my consciousness and the promise she had made. &quot;Oh, Anemo Archon, I beg you to turn
us into humans! For only then can we be safe from their hunting bows and knives.&quot; ... When I awoke, I found myself in
the woods behind my village. The woods were full of lush trees, and at the center of the woods was a small lake. The
lake was like the stained glass windows of the Mondstadt Cathedral: crystal clear and shimmering in the sunlight. The
sun shone through the treetops and glistened on the water's surface like fragments of gemstone. It was really something.
The weather was cool that day. I was hunting in the forest when I arrived at the lake's edge. The shimmering water
somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago. I couldn't remember much about her, but I felt that her eyes must
have looked like the lake, glittering as if harboring fragments of gemstone within. Hmm. I must have lost myself in
thought that day, drifting off into sleep as I watched the sparkling lake.</p>

<p>Friends of Mondstadt, let us revel! Drink to your hearts' content!<br />
To freedom! To the Anemo Archon!<br />
To Vennessa, the first Knight to grace this world!<br />
Sons and daughters of Mondstadt, may the gift from the Anemo Archon be engraved in your hearts!<br />
And let it be known that this gift is not freedom, but just defiance!</p>
<p>It transpired in ages past.<br />
Friends, do excuse me for improvising,<br />
For it should be clear as day, that the glory and freedom of Mondstadt<br />
Were born when Barbatos struck the strings dolce.<br />
Poems sing of heroic fame,<br />
Yet to commemorate unnamed freedom should they aim.</p>
<p>Chained by royals, Mondstadt could barely suspire,<br />
And festivities were but vanity games of the rich,<br />
Beyond the grasp of the ordinary people.<br />
A withering dungeon, Mondstadt was.<br />
In slavery games the royal gaily relished,<br />
Oblivious to their place, the inmates were.</p>
<p>A fiery-headed dame confined to a cell,<br />
From the southern plains she did hail.<br />
Born free but now bound by chains,<br />
Though restrained by a tyrant her flesh remained.<br />
Still her pious soul never ceased to pray,<br />
For her people, for Mondstadt, for illusive freedom if she may.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-9"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-9">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>Friends of Mondstadt, let us revel! Drink to your hearts' content!<br />
The day came when Barbatos answered her devotion.<br />
The Anemo Archon sought her fiery hair and descended to her position.<br />
&quot;Every being deserves a name,&quot; the spirit grinned.<br />
&quot;To weave your fair name into a song I yearn,&quot;<br />
&quot;I seek nothing but your friendship in return.&quot;<br />
The girl happily reciprocated, her fears swiftly dissipated.</p>
<p>And so, to the battlefield she marched to Barbatos' singing voice,<br />
The demonic dragon fled from her might and the people did rejoice.<br />
Corpulent aristocrats crawled under tables at such a valiant sight.<br />
&quot;Mondstadt is freedom,&quot; the winds sang for their people in delight.<br />
Lonely forest breezes converged, jointly they overthrew the tyrant's tower from the sky.<br />
Broken free from shackles at last, the young lioness stood firm in the winds with her head held high.</p>
<p>And so, the fiery-headed dame won herself prestigious fame.<br />
Her heart swelled with appreciation to sing by the Anemo Archon's side.<br />
But no words of gratitude should she utter, Barbatos replied:<br />
&quot;You first conducted what now transpires in your song.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have entrusted me with your friendship and your name.&quot;<br />
&quot;To praise your freedom, my songs came.&quot;</p>
<p>Friends, let us drink some more!<br />
For thence flows the freedom of Mondstadt.<br />
When days become nights and faces fill with despair,<br />
Never forget the heroic tales of Vennessa, the dame with the flaming hair!<br />
Never cease to pursue freedom, even when the land is bare!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-mondstadt-tower"><a class="header" href="#the-mondstadt-tower">The Mondstadt Tower</a></h1>
<p>In the time of the aristocrats, there stood a high tower in Mondstadt's plaza. It was built to honor Barbatos the Anemo
Archon in name, yet in reality it was nothing more than a flamboyant display of wealth and power by the royal to gloat
over the commoners. The one time in the year that the commoners living in these dark times could find a little solace
was during Ludi Harpastum. During one Ludi Harpastum, a wandering singer from a distant land arrived in the city. The
name of the lass was Inès, and everyone at the festival was enchanted by her stunning beauty. People of all ages and all
walks of life vied to catch a glimpse of her throwing the Harpastum and to hear her sing foreign ballads.</p>
<p>&quot;The blessings of Barbatos are for everyone! You are only sinful if you are bitter at such a joyous occasion!&quot;</p>
<p>As she sang these verses, she handed out her earnings during the festival to the poor and orphans in the city. A frail
figure stood amongst the crowds. He was the Seneschal, and he fell for her at first sight. But his religious piety
filled him with a frustration at his inability to suppress the emotions he was experiencing, and her acts of charity,
which violated the Church's right to aid to the poor, irked him all the more. As is known to all, the beliefs of
contemporary Mondstadters hold that the Anemo Archon Barbatos encourages people to seek love and pursue freedom, but in
the dark ages the Anemo Archon slept, and the city of tormented by the tyranny of the nobles, the poverty of the
commoners, and the ravage of the dragon; meanwhile, the self-proclaimed &quot;orthodox&quot; church — a mere figurehead,
controlled by the ruling class — advocated abstinence from earthly pleasure to avert divine punishment. Under such
circumstances, even the harp which symbolized the wind had been restricted to playing only those songs deemed &quot;holy.&quot;
However, the notion of &quot;divine punishment&quot; was little more than an excuse fabricated by the nobles to conceal their
avarice and restrict the commoners.</p>
<p>&quot;To let her stay in the city is to bewitch all its inhabitants. What wickedness will this witch bring?&quot; The Seneschal
pondered.</p>
<p>And so, the Seneschal plotted to hunt down Inès, and to confine her to the Cathedral while awaiting further
instructions. As per the traditions of the time, the maiden chosen to throw the Harpastum should serve at the royal
court for three days after the celebration, under the protection of the aristocrats. The Seneschal decided to send his
adopted son, Octave, to sneak into the royal court and abduct Inès. Octave was an unwelcome child, abandoned by his
superstitious parents at birth and later raised by the Seneschal. As a child, he was persecuted and abused by the
citizens, seen as a bad omen of draconic disasters. The only person who protected Octave was the Seneschal, who treated
him like his own son and thus won his utmost trust.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring the maiden who threw the Harpastum yesterday to me! Disturb no one and do not mention my name.&quot;</p>
<p>Under orders from the Seneschal, Octave climbed onto the balcony of the court chambers at nightfall. Upon seeing the
girl weeping in the moonlight, his pure heart was stirred, for he had never seen such a wondrous sight. He gazed at the
girl, leaving his task forgotten. But the silence of the tranquil moment shared by Octave and the girl was interrupted
by the servants...</p>

<p>In the distant past, the Night Mother ruled over the faraway Land of Night. Here, no light touched the earth, nor did a
single tree grow, and there was no life here but the horrendous denizens of the dark. The Night Mother was the source of
all sins, and the Land of Night was the embodiment of her evilness. The cruel Night Mother, who had neither heart nor
mouth, was always watching the Land of Night, and her punishments were always unexpected. The only thing she could not
bear was the occasional ray of moonlight that made it through the clouds. The light that penetrated the walls of
darkness always irritated her.</p>
<p>The Moonlight Forest was the only place free from the rule of the Night Mother. Only there could the people bask in the
bright moonlight and enjoy the grace it brought to the living. Everyone in the Kingdom of the Moonlight Forest was born
with fair skin, light-colored hair, and bright blue eyes. Perhaps the constant lack of sunlight and the nourishment of
the moonlight was the reason for their beauty, giving them an appearance different from the abhorrent creatures lurking
at the edge of the forest.</p>

<p>&quot;There are times when I think to myself... There's nothing to do in this tiny village. What a dull place to live.&quot; This
wasn't the first time that Vera had complained about her hometown, the small country village of Delphi. Her frown eased
slightly as she lay on the hillside near the village, eyes closed, feeling the breeze of the early summer. &quot;Then where
in this world would you not consider dull?&quot; Her buddy Sachi asked curiously. Vera sat up and leaned forward. &quot;I believe
on the other side of the Starry Sea is a planet inhabited by gods who can answer all prayers and wishes, and everyone
bearing a wish is on a journey to get there. I believe, in our universe, there is a world currently in a war against
doomsday, where the noble and elegant souls of fourteen Valkyries burn bright, if only for a brief but magnificent
moment...&quot; &quot;You've been reading too many of those weird fantasy novels.&quot; &quot;But... this village really IS dull. When was
the last time anything fun happened here?&quot; &quot;Funny you should say that, a new family did move into our village
recently...&quot; &quot;Novelty and fun aren't the same thing!&quot; Despite what she had said, Vera decided to pay a visit to the
newcomers. Sachi, however, remembered his family's rules, and walked back home for dinner.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Vera gave the door to the newcomer's abode a gentle push. Much to her surprise, it wasn't locked. &quot;Anybody home?&quot; No
sooner had the words left her mouth than the living room cupboard doors flew open and out jumped a black-haired boy
wearing glasses. He was followed by a tentacled blue slime. &quot;Make way! Tal, why did you let a stranger in?&quot; The
black-haired boy gently pushed Vera out of his way and picked up an axe by the door. &quot;You leave me with no choice. Since
you have seen everything, there is only one thing for it...&quot; Thus began the biggest crisis of Vera's life.</p>

<p>&quot;All I can do now is ask you to help me.&quot; The black-haired boy, who called himself Ike, handed Vera a kitchen knife. He
walked back to the cupboard and began slashing at the tentacles frantically. &quot;Come and help me close this door! If a
tentacle starts attacking you, use this kitchen knife to defend yourself!&quot; Ike's glasses were now covered in blue slime.
&quot;Hurry! We can't let this evil demon cross into Delphi.&quot; Upon hearing his words, Vera helped Ike close the door. While
they were pushing back the tentacles, Vera accidentally stabbed Ike twice in the back. Thankfully, Ike's healing spells
were quite potent. &quot;I shall explain everything to you. I am in fact over a thousand years old, and this door is a
gateway to anywhere in the universe. That tentacled monster is an old one from the Large Magellanic Cloud — I went there
to get something.&quot; Ike was covered in slime from head to foot by this point. He wiped his glasses with Vera's dress as
he spoke. &quot;Erm... is there anything else that you'd like to know?&quot; &quot;Who's Tal?&quot; Vera didn't seem to mind. &quot;An evil
spirit that resided in the man-devouring castle. It has served me as a butler since I subdued it. Strangely, it behaved
quite friendly towards you.&quot;</p>
<p>Vera's parents always reminded her that people are destined to build families, and that it was futile to entertain
dreams of anything beyond the homestead. Her buddy Sachi once told her that if a lively girl like her was to marry
someone from a faraway land, the whole village would become unbearably lonely. (The real reason Sachi said this was that
he was something of a weakling, and was sure to be ferociously bullied if he ended up having to play with the boys.)
&quot;The human spirit is still too immature. I need to guide you both through the wonders of your childhood.&quot; Ike extended
his inviting arms to Vera. &quot;You will sing every step of the way on your long journey to youth.&quot; From the Orion Arm to
the Eternal Jahanam, from the Torrents of Time to the depths of the Starry Sea... &quot;How far is 'beyond'? Any place in
this universe is just as boring as my backyard,&quot; he said. &quot;The scale of everything beyond follows the heart,&quot; Ike
replied. &quot;Thus, my heart is slightly bigger than the entire universe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am the second rightful heir to the Andromeda Empire, and I have more than two hundred titles to my name. You shall
call me the Princess Andro-Basilisks.&quot; The charming girl then crossed her arms, savoring the moment of her entrance in
her mind and giggling to herself in amusement. Her sole reason for gracing Delphi with her presence was to marry Ike.
&quot;If you, he who conquered a quarter of the universe, marry me, my safety shall be guaranteed after my elder sister takes
the throne.&quot; &quot;If I may ask, how big is the Andromeda Empire?&quot; Vera asked. &quot;I reckon there are more than nine thousand
inhabitable planets.&quot; ——With so many stars in your possession, why come to steal my brilliance?</p>
<p>&quot;So you aren't here to harm Vera?&quot; Sachi cautiously asked Ike, who was carrying the scrolls and globes of other planets.
&quot;Of course not. I think she would make a great assistant.&quot; After putting everything down he clapped his hands. &quot;You like
her?&quot; &quot;Me? No, not at all, I don't like her at all!&quot; Sachi looked away, worried that the old sage might discern his true
feelings. He reached for a box full of photo frames. He grabbed a few at random, each picture depicting a different
beauty. &quot;Look at them... They all said that they gave me their one and only true love, but did they? In reality, I was
just one of their many lovers.&quot; Sachi did not know when or where he had heard the saying, but it blurted out from his
mouth in his moment of annoyance: &quot;With so many stars in your possession, why come to steal my brilliance?&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-all-that-glitters"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-all-that-glitters">Volume 4: All that Glitters</a></h2>
<p>&quot;The people in these photographs are all so pretty,&quot; Vera exclaimed as she picked up Ike's box of framed photos. &quot;Of
course they are — otherwise, they wouldn't have had the chance to leave me with a photograph to remember them by.&quot; Ike
has no intention of evading. After all, he was a galactic sage who was over a thousand years old. So of course he knew
that girls were easily hurt, and that they could become trouble very easily. Ike would thus never cheat a girl — take
notes, boys. &quot;Having seen the starry host, I thus make star-shaped jewels to remember them by,&quot; he continued to explain.
&quot;But those stars that shine across the universe do not belong to anyone. So it is also impossible to steal them.&quot; Vera
did not understand. &quot;What are you saying?&quot; &quot;I'm saying this for the sake of a foolish fellow who isn't present right
now. Pay it no mind, humans are just far too young.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will serve as a go-between between you and Ike.&quot; Sachi said to the Princess of the Andromeda Empire in a loud voice.
&quot;Huh?&quot; &quot;I love Vera, I don't—&quot; &quot;Disgusting. Boring. Be silent, worm. You are an offense to my ears. I've already
acknowledged Vera as my friend. I will not hand her over to a cowardly person like you...&quot; &quot;Wh—What...&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-roadside-picnic"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-roadside-picnic">Volume 5: Roadside Picnic</a></h2>
<p>When Ike was taking a nap, his servants waged a terrible war against each other. The great wizard had subdued many gods
and demons to serve under him. As the most formidable wizard of his day, Ike was in command of gods and demons more
numerous than the entries in a dictionary. But who was the strongest of those under his rule? The gods and demons
decided to find out for themselves through battle. Unfortunately, they seemed to have erroneously regarded as their own
three who were neither gods nor demons: the Princess, Sachi, and Vera. Ike only slept for two hours, but in that time
three stars had already been destroyed!</p>
<p>&quot;Why should I protect you?&quot; The Princess pulled her hand away, and the giant demon plummeted to the ground, its eyeballs
gone. The dominant race of the Andromeda Empire may look lovely and sweet, but on their palms grow two special mouths,
which they use to devour the eyeballs of their lovers and those they vanquish. &quot;Are we no friends?&quot; Vera wiped the blood
off her face, and appeared to be hurt by the Princess' words. &quot;Yea - yes,&quot; The Princess blushed and looked away. &quot;I
already regard you as my only friend for what has happened. I was not referring to you, Vera.&quot; &quot;No!&quot; Sachi yelled as the
gnarly jaws of a dragon closed around him. &quot;Do you surrender to me now?&quot; The giant dragon jeered. &quot;Surrender and concede
that you are worthless, lowly rats, and I shall let you live!&quot; &quot;I surrender! I surrender! Let me go!&quot; Sachi screamed.
&quot;Why, a lizard of your despicable breed should know better than to utter such foolish words! Even the geckos in my
palace could crush you.&quot; The Princess gave her wrists a twirl. &quot;No! This has nothing to do with me!&quot; Sachi yelled as the
dragon cast him into the sky. And just like that, the battle between the dominant species of Andromeda and the ancient
giant dragon was over.</p>
<p>The moral? You won't get hurt if you just surrender. Sachi was knocked out of the contest and woke Ike up with the slap
of a slipper. Vera also survived thanks to the protection of the Princess. &quot;Argh! You imbecile! The mere sight of you is
revolting. Do not come near me! Don't talk to me, don't look at me, nor breathe the same air as me, you lowly scum!&quot; The
Princess could not have a lower opinion of Sachi.</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-for-every-season"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-for-every-season">Volume 6: For Every Season</a></h2>
<p>Though those things had indeed happened, they were occurrences on a galactic scale. Now, something more mundane was
about to happen. The date of the town festival was drawing near. &quot;I suppose it's finally my turn to introduce you two to
this small town, then?&quot; Vera said as she served the Princess and Ike her very own braised dishes. After all, those
things they had encountered in their galactic escapades had to be explained by the Princess and Ike. If there was any
knowledge Vera had to present to them, it was the knowledge of her hometown. &quot;...Afterward, the great king's first
messenger, the brave knight Huffman strode west across two continents, crossing great oceans and rivers. As for the
imperial sage, the witch from the east, she passed by her hometown on her road eastward, and then came by the land of
the Nether. Thus, they finally met here.&quot; &quot;Huh, is that so. How interesting.&quot; Though she was trying hard not to let Vera
notice that she did not in fact care for the story at all, the Princess' acting skills required some work. &quot;So that can
only mean that this place is on the polar opposite side of this world from the great king's capital, right?&quot; Ike said,
commenting on a seemingly unimportant aspect of the tale. &quot;Ahahaha, that's true if you think about it.&quot; Vera rubbed the
back of her head with a crooked smile.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always said that I want to leave this place, but in the end, I discovered that this is the place I'm most familiar
with.&quot; Having come to this realization on the eve of the town's anniversary, Vera began crying right in front of Sachi's
eyes. &quot;You numbskull! You made Vera cry!&quot; The Princess made her entry with a flying kick, sending Sachi hurtling away.</p>
<h2 id="volume-7-galaxy-wars"><a class="header" href="#volume-7-galaxy-wars">Volume 7: Galaxy Wars</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Re-igniting a sun is not difficult, but I don't think the Andromeda Empire would like to see that happen,&quot; Ike said to
the panicked Vera. &quot;Do you mean that the Princess has kidnapped Sachi?&quot; Vera said with some shock in her voice after
giving the matter some thought. &quot;How did you come to that conclusion? I'm saying that only the Andromeda Empire would be
capable of kidnapping you and the Princess.&quot; Ike then turned to face the innumerable lives that dwelled within the
galaxy. He paused for a moment before declaring thus: &quot;Inhabitants of the galaxy. Though I have come here upon the
invitation of the High Saint King Lebannin to re-ignite the flames of the few remaining stars, it seems the Andromeda
Empire does not wish for your longevity, and has thus kidnapped my friend.&quot; &quot;Are you then to put their lives over that
of all life?&quot; Saint King Lebannin arose from her seat. &quot;If that is the case, why then do I rule over these stars?&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, the Saint King would charge into peril alone, defeat the assassins from the Andromeda Empire, and rescue both
the Princess and Sachi. Afterward, she had a few words with Ike. &quot;I didn't think you could defeat the dominant species
of Andromeda,&quot; Ike praised. &quot;They're a strong and hardy race. I suppose it's true, the, that you defeated the holy
dragon en route to becoming the Saint King.&quot; &quot;I am, in fact, that same holy dragon. I fused with Lebannin's flesh and
blood, and now act according to her wishes.&quot; &quot;Huh...&quot; Ike was a little shocked by this. &quot;Ah, yes. Is that the fellow the
person the Second Princess is fond of? When I barged in, they were...&quot; &quot;What!?&quot; Now that was a much bigger shock for
Ike.</p>
<h2 id="volume-8-the-girls-themselves"><a class="header" href="#volume-8-the-girls-themselves">Volume 8: The Girls Themselves</a></h2>
<p>&quot;I said it was a misunderstanding! She was about to eat me.&quot; Sachi explained. &quot;I don't think she was intending to eat
you,&quot; Ike said, pushing his glasses up. &quot;The dominant race of the Andromeda Empire have organs on the palms of their
hands that allow them to capture and consume eyeballs.&quot; &quot;I've seen it before. Looks like some sort of... lamprey?&quot; Sachi
shivered a little as he said that last word. &quot;Let me finish.&quot; Ike wanted to touch his eyes, but wound up pressing his
fingerprint into his glasses. Taking his glasses off, he touched his left eye. &quot;Their practice of eating eyes has two
meanings: submission...&quot; He touched his right eye. &quot;...and love.&quot; Sachi also began to rub both his eyes, thinking about
which it was back then. &quot;Whatever the case, I don't think the princess really understands the difference. Those who
submit to her, those things she conquers, those who love her — they're all the same to her. People who can't hurt her in
an imperial succession battle.&quot; &quot;Huh. No wonder those Andromeda Empire assassins kidnapped her. Two birds with one
stone, eh?&quot; &quot;I'm not getting involved in their succession wars. I can only help you support her better.&quot; &quot;Hey now —
we're not like that! I mean, doesn't she hate me the most?&quot;</p>
<p>And what were the girls talking about at this very moment? That may yet be an eternal mystery.</p>
<h2 id="volume-9-death-awaits-in-abyssal-waves"><a class="header" href="#volume-9-death-awaits-in-abyssal-waves">Volume 9: Death Awaits in Abyssal Waves</a></h2>
<p>As Vera and Sachi grew up, the chemistry between the four changed in subtle and inexplicable ways. &quot;Enough with
excuses,&quot; Sachi said to Ike. &quot;Vera will not cease pursuing you even if you never reciprocate her feelings.&quot; Ike was a
symbol of a faraway land. He stood for the unknown, for that which was waiting to be discovered. A brave bird would
never nest there, but would be forever adrift in the winds of admiration. Ike retorted, &quot;No matter which way you look at
it, being a thousand years old makes you an elderly person.&quot; &quot;Then we are well-matched in age.&quot; The Princess merrily
chipped in on their conversation.</p>
<p>When Sachi finally mustered the courage to declare his love, he met with the most dreadful fate. Remember the ancient
sword that Ike and Vera received from the old ones when they first met? It was what Ike needed to propel destiny
forward! But now, Vera had her finger slit by its blade, and a malicious ancient virus sapped the life out of her.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all your fault!&quot; Sachi grabbed Ike by the collar. If the tragedy had not happened, Ike would have laughed it
off, for he was a gentle soul. But this time, he slapped Sachi's hand away. &quot;Don't you know how to rewind time? Please
Do it to save Vera!&quot; Even the Princess begged. &quot;You don't understand. Only the future can save the past, not the other
way around.&quot; Ike bit his lip until blood came flowing down.</p>
<p>&quot;A local myth speaks of a Silver Age when people enjoyed a seemingly endless childhood that could last up to two hundred
years. This only made their short maturity a pain to bear.&quot; To the others, childhood was long gone, but youth was
forever beyond their reach. To be continued in &quot;Vera's Melancholy&quot; without Vera.</p>
<h2 id="volume-10-veras-melancholy"><a class="header" href="#volume-10-veras-melancholy">Volume 10: Vera's Melancholy</a></h2>
<p>To revive Vera, Sachi, Ike and the Princess embarked on a spectacular and thrilling journey that lasted twenty years.
From battling Signor Inferno to slaying the Star Devourer, the trio had even rescued two galaxies and the Galaxy Empire,
and eliminated four species of ruthless interstellar worms along the way. When Vera opened her eyes, she found herself
in the arms of Sachi, now a hero of cosmic proportions. To the dominant species of Andromeda, twenty years was nothing
more than a few seconds. The Princess looked lovely as always, but her countenance was a curious mix of genuine
happiness and loss. Sachi, having lost an eye in his adventures, was now a tall and strapping young man. His flowing
tears soaked into Vera's shoulders — though still prone to tears, he was no longer his feeble-minded self. The years had
been kind to Ike, who after all this time still had that same old smile on his face. &quot;I am but an echo of time,&quot; Ike
said as he began his preparations. &quot;As I've said, the past cannot change the future, for the predetermined rules of
equilibrium are slightly more powerful than me. But the future, with its infinite possibilities, could save the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Ike transformed Sachi back into what he was twenty years ago, and time reversed itself to the day of their departure.
Everything seemed to remain unchanged between the four, though they realized that the innocence they once shared was one
thing that could never return. &quot;I am sorry for depriving you of your childhood,&quot; Ike said to him. &quot;Now go, the youth
that you deserve awaits.&quot; &quot;I have witnessed every wonder in the universe for your sake, and this was how my childhood
ended.&quot; Sachi summoned every last ounce of his courage as he stood before the girl of his destiny. &quot;I will never reach
my youth without you by my side.&quot;</p>
<p>What will her answer be?</p>

<p>But no way to fly</p>
<p>They asked the Anemo God:</p>
<p>&quot;How can we reach the heavens?&quot;</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="customs-of-liyue"><a class="header" href="#customs-of-liyue">Customs of Liyue</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-flower-ball"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-flower-ball">Volume 1: Flower Ball</a></h2>
<p>It is customary at weddings in Liyue for the bride to cast a flower ball towards the oncoming crowd of guests. It is
said that the one fortunate enough to catch it will enjoy a year of good luck: business owners will see their wealth
increase, the poor will see their fortunes turn around, the single will encounter their fated partners, and the married
will see their shared life blossom with mutual love and appreciation, never again to descend into petty squabbles over
life's daily vexations.</p>
<p>While some brides use a real flower ball, many alternatives exist depending on the family's wealth. The rich tend to use
woven balls with silk from the Silk Flower, while the poor fashion theirs from colored paper or cloth. But the custom
itself is observed in the same fashion at all of Liyue's weddings, even though the fortunes of individual families may
differ.</p>
<p>Some say the Liyue custom was originally adopted from the Ludi Harpastum festival celebrated in the neighboring Wind
Kingdom of Mondstadt. Others say it dates back to before the Archon War, when the Salt God roamed free in Liyue. She
once stood shoulder to shoulder with the many gods of Liyue, but her extraordinarily gentle nature saw her quickly
ousted in the hubris of the Archon War, before being ruthlessly murdered by one of her own followers.</p>
<p>Her remains are likely to be found somewhere in the ruins of the area known as &quot;Sal Terrae.&quot; According to a legend that
time has unfortunately stripped of all useful detail, she once handed out bunches of flowers to her people as a blessing
to them. Or at least, if not a blessing, then a small gesture of comfort to stave off the bitterness of wartime
existence. In any case, following her return to the elements, it is conceivable that her followers spread across Liyue,
took this custom with them, and taught it to the locals. The people of Liyue being a competitive and fun-loving folk,
they may then have adapted it and embellished upon it to suit their own preferences.</p>
<p>Despite being a benign and joyful celebration at heart, security logs from the Millelith indicate that the throwing of
flower balls is responsible for a significant number of injuries every year. In fact, the number of cases is more or
less the same as those caused by monster attacks.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-receiving-god"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-receiving-god">Volume 2: Receiving God</a></h2>
<p>Of all the celebrations, ceremonies, and customs of Liyue, none is more iconic than that held in reception of their god:
the &quot;Rite of Descension.&quot;</p>
<p>It is during this rite that the Geo Archon, Liyue's deity and watchful guardian over the ages, descends in person upon
the mortal realm to issue his divine proclamations and exhort the people to be guided by the wisdom they contain, so
that all things may transpire in accordance with established rules instead of tending towards chaos.</p>
<p>In the earliest and humblest days of Liyue's history, Liyue's farmer-forebears would elect community representatives to
greet the Geo Archon on arrival and give him an appropriate send-off on departure.</p>
<p>After making lavish offerings and reciting solemn blessings, they would listen in reverence to their god's divine
predictions, before announcing to the people the vision for their labor in the year ahead. In this way, mortals were
guided along the path towards prosperity and to triumph over the obstacles that lay in their way, and thus did the
domain of the Geo Archon remain strong and steadfast.</p>
<p>When peace returned once more after the Archon War, the city of Liyue Harbor began to flourish under the government of
the Qixing, who represented every trade in Liyue, and who also acted as intermediaries between mortals and their god,
taking responsibility for communicating with the Geo Archon, explaining his divine predictions to the people in clear
and simple terms, and issuing the official policy for the forthcoming year.</p>
<p>Naturally, the illustrious individual tasked with hosting the Rite of Descension can only be chosen from among the
Qixing, and no one other than that person is permitted to intervene in the proceedings.</p>
<p>In the minds of the many merchants of Liyue Harbor, the divine predictions of Rex Lapis are more precious than the
metals and minerals of the mountain mines.</p>
<p>Thus, no matter how far from home they may have strayed by the day that Rex Lapis descends, all will seek to make the
journey back in person, or at least send someone in their place, so that they may receive the guidance of the Geo Archon
and safeguard their financial fortunes for the year ahead.</p>
<p>The raving-mad sages of the nation of rainforests drive themselves to hysterics as they abandon all that is worldly in
their pursuit of elusive and esoteric wisdom, but the people of the land of karst cliffs are accustomed to welcoming the
generous guidance of their deity as a means towards a worldly end — namely, their continued prosperity.</p>
<p>It would seem that, while The Seven stand shoulder-to-shoulder in their roles as Archons of the mortal realm, there are
moments where their paths diverge, and even run directly counter to one another.</p>

<p>For the well-to-do citizens of Liyue, the Silk Flower has a ubiquitous presence in their lives: It has a beautiful color
and its soft petals can be processed to make silk. It also has a most delightful scent that can survive multiple rounds
of processing, and even the weaving process itself. For this reason, Liyue's botanists have cultivated a special strain
for exclusive use in perfume making — with the most luxurious perfumes being offered first and foremost, of course, to
Rex Lapis for his approval.</p>
<p>For the women of Liyue, highly prized Silk Flower perfumes are seen as holding different symbolic meanings based on the
fragrance profile and composition. The unwritten rule in Liyue is that it is impolite to broach the topic of perfume
with a woman in normal social interaction, but also that if an admirer is able to correctly guess the type of perfume
one is wearing, as well as correctly deduce its unique properties and characteristics, all whilst conveying this in an
articulate and tactful manner, the admirer is more likely to stand a chance of winning one's affection.</p>
<p>A popular belief in the rural regions of Liyue is that the method for decocting Silk Flower perfume was originally
taught to mortals by an adeptus living as a hermit on Mt. Aocang. In the age where divine beings coexisted alongside
lowly mortals, the adeptus guided humans to learn the ways of courting and romancing from the birds, beasts, and plants.
To a young woman bathing in a spring, it once took the form of a graceful illuminated bird, teaching her the exotic
techniques of decocting and applying fragrant oils.</p>
<p>Who was this young woman capable of stirring the heart of an adeptus living in deliberate seclusion from the world? With
countless legends offering different versions of the story, the truth is impossible to know. But the art of decocting
perfume from Silk Flowers was indeed passed on, for it survives to this very day. It is claimed that the subtle
undertones of the perfume's scent and the gentle-but-nimble hand techniques used in the decoction process have remained
unchanged throughout history on account of having proved themselves supremely fit for purpose time and time again.</p>
<p>As they grow, Silk Flowers will exhibit different properties based on how their environmental conditions differ from
their ancestral habitat. Liyue's merchants have coined plenty of tasteless terms for Silk Flowers of all types and uses.
They tend to attribute them to Rex Lapis, claiming they once had the fortune to encounter him during one of his
excursions in the mortal realm or pass them off as a merciful gift from an adeptus, such details always featuring as
part of a wondrous, fantastical narrative. Sales tactics like these always manage to garner the interest of a shopper or
two on their way through Liyue Harbor.</p>
<p>High demand has pushed Liyue's merchants towards the mass cultivation of Silk Flowers and the ongoing breeding of new
strains. This means that the striking sight of beautiful Silk Flowers is a common one in all highly populated areas,
including the city and the towns. Sadly, geographical changes over Liyue's long history and ever-expanding mining
activity have conspired to destroy the natural habitat of wild Silk Flowers, meaning that the flower is all but extinct
in rural areas. The handful that can still be found in the wild are carefully looked after by adepti living in seclusion
there. These Silk Flowers feature daintier, more elegant blossoms, which puts them in stark contrast to those cultivated
by horticulturalists in urban centers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the people of Liyue see the pretty and sweet-smelling Silk Flower as one of the many symbols of Rex
Lapis. Which begs the question: Has this mighty and imposing god, who typically takes a decidedly masculine form on his
excursions to the mortal realm, ever taken the form of a woman and accepted a ritual offering in the form of a bunch of
flowers? The sparse historical records on the one hand and the plethora of rumors of obscure origin on the other means
that, while this claim is more or less impossible to verify, it also cannot be simply dismissed as baseless speculation.</p>
<p>On a personal note — the writer has, on one occasion, personally witnessed a Statue of The Seven accept a carefully
prepared and distinctly feminine gift that was presented to it in worship. As for the Geo Archon's innermost feelings
upon receiving offerings from their subjects, however, this is not something that I, as an outsider in Liyue, consider
myself qualified to comment on.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="legend-of-the-lone-sword"><a class="header" href="#legend-of-the-lone-sword">Legend of the Lone Sword</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-11"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-11">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>A single sword's light pierced the night air, unchallenged by star or moon. The autumn wind in the mountains wept aloud,
following the whirling dance of the lonesome blade.</p>
<p>Driving wind and falling rain accompanied a single traveler on their journey home.</p>
<p>This person's hair was wild, and his face fierce, and his seemed most fey indeed. His clothes were thin, and he swayed
this way and that in the center of the homeward path like on sick or hurt to the quick, seeming more like some ghoul
than a living man.</p>
<p>He had been on the path three days. Three days he had gone hungry, and without any sleep.</p>
<p>Three days ago, he had a name, and had a famed sword, and his fallen martial arts school. But now, he only wore sorrow
and worry on his brow, which rolled off him, carried by the sudden rain, and onto the mud below, eroding the soil.</p>
<p>Three days ago, that nameless swordsman had started a feud with him, a feud that saw his master and junior buried in the
merciless mountain snow as the screaming snow was stained red.</p>
<p>Today, he had a new name — Jin the Seventy-Second. For he was the last of the 72 members of their school.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>He did not know how long he had walked, before he heard the sound of carts behind him.</p>
<p>Jin the Seventy-Second shuffled to the side of the road and stopped, asking: &quot;Is your cart headed for Tupi Village?&quot;</p>
<p>The cart driver saluted him and replied: &quot;Few of the carts on this road do not do so.&quot;</p>
<p>Jin the Seventy-Second then asked: &quot;Then pray will your cart bear another man?&quot;</p>
<p>The cart driver said: &quot;It could, but you did not ask if I would.&quot;</p>
<p>Jin the Seventy-Second did not understand. &quot;If you travel to Tupi Village, why would you not take me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For you are not I, nor I, you,&quot; the driver replied.</p>
<p>&quot;What a waste of words.&quot;</p>
<p>And no sooner had that been said than the blade left its sheath. The cart driver felt but a single chilling cold, and
fell from his cart to the floor without a struggle, never to speak again.</p>
<p>Jin the Seventy-Second was just such a person. Though he had lost everything, even his heart, and his bold brashness had
ebbed, he had always hated pointlessly talkative people most of all.</p>
<p>Riding the bloodstained cart, Jin the Seventy-Second departed for Tupi Village.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-10"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-10">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>They say that in that faraway land, &quot;Tupi&quot; meant to burn away vanity's dross to attain the gem of truth.</p>
<p>Tupi Village lay at the foot of a barren mountain, passable to the outside world only by a single ancient path — the
very same that lay beneath Jin the Seventy-Second's feet.</p>
<p>The skies were darkening, and the wind and rain howled.</p>
<p>Jin the Seventy-Second had never had anything to do with Tupi Village, but for his vengeance, and so he now sought out
its village chief.</p>
<p>By the time the oxcart had finally trudged its way through the muddy old road to the mountain's base, it was fully
night, and gloomy clouds cast a boundless shadow as they covered the moon's eyes. Jin the Seventy-Second hid in that
shade, drinking the night in, body and soul.</p>
<p>In that deep night, the pure white light of the moon shone upon the head of the village chief. Tupi Village had never
been large, but the chief was no ordinary character. No one knew his name or his past, and no one dared to ask.</p>
<p>They only knew that his shoulders bore a great blood debt, from a past as crimson as his eyes.</p>
<p>For red they were, and sharp, like a blade, piercing the hearts of all he gazed upon as he pleased. His character was
much the same, like a sharp knife that might pierce another person's heart at any time without forewarning.</p>
<p>&quot;It's time.&quot; The chief shook his head as he talked to himself, the cold moonlight dancing over his shaven crown.</p>
<p>Outside, a ravenous demon wielded a blood-letting long sword, massacring his followers one after the other. Though Tupi
Village was full of evil people, schools and sects had their rules, and so none would dare come knocking with rash
provocations and talk of revenge. But Jin the Seventy-Second had no school or sect, and was thus unbound by any such
rules. He was but a single starving ghost with a lone sharp blade, yearning to taste the blood of his enemies.</p>
<p>The wind and rain accompanied the din of battle, and the downpour washed away the crimson that stained the swordsman,
only for another layer to be painted on immediately...</p>
<p>The crimson swordsman strode forward amid a crimson mist. Many were his wounds, but none could stay his hand.</p>
<p>When that mist had at last cleared in the endless deluge, the swordsman crossed the turbid red beneath his feet, and
stalked towards the chief's mansion.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The din beyond the gates quieted, and only now did the chief raise a cup of wine, and scatter the alcohol into the air
with a flick. Perhaps to toast the fated meeting to come, or as a ritual for his sullied soul.</p>
<p>The doors opened. It was Jin the Seventy-Second, his reddened outline juxtaposed against the blinding gray elements
outside.</p>
<p>&quot;I have questions for you, village chief.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've taken quite a few of my men's lives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly three hundred and sixty-two. No more, no less...&quot;</p>
<p>The chief spoke naught, and his face remained still, but the pulsing vein in his temple betrayed the fire within.</p>
<p>&quot;...Ah yes, and one dog.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, the crimson silhouette tossed a certain object forward. It clattered atop the wind case... ...And it was the
bone of the dog that guarded the door. It had been stewed for a time, and was picked clean almost to the marrow.</p>
<p>For in this half an hour, not only had Jin the Seventy-Second snuffed out the lives of three hundred and sixty-two able
men, but he had even turned the dog keeping the gate into dog meat stew.</p>
<p>What cruelty. What ruthlessness!</p>
<p>The village chief let out a terrible scream, and standing, he drew his sword—</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-7"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-7">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>The rain had ceased, but light had yet to recoup the skies.</p>
<p>Jin the Seventy-Second had obtained news of his nemesis from the mouth of the village chief. Now, not a thing was left
in Tupi Village but masterless rooms, and masterless spirits.</p>
<p>And not even that remained, for this was a world without spirits. This world possessed no elemental power, And so, the
memories of the dead could not remain in the mortal realm via elemental resonance.</p>
<p>The village chief was a formidable foe. His blade was as swift as could be, and he had left many wounds on Jin the
Seventy-Second, each deep enough to cut bone. But alas, his &quot;heart&quot; was far too slow.</p>
<p>For this was a world without elements, And thus swordsmanship could not be imbued with them. Swordsmanship was thus a
question of pure physical skill and not elemental control. The sword is an extension of one's body, and one uses it as
an arm would command the fingers, or as one's heart directs the eyes. Though he was skilled indeed in the art of the
swift blade, the village chief never understood the value of the &quot;heart,&quot; and so he fell to a single stroke.</p>
<p>Jin the Seventy-Second strode towards the fallen chief, discarding the broken incense burner in his left hand.</p>
<p>For the chief had focused too narrowly on pouring savage strokes upon the swordsman's body, thinking them too harried to
fight back, and had no eyes for his enemy's left hand, which should have been empty—</p>
<p>—And in a flash, the incense burner had struck the chief of Tupi Village on the forehead, sending him tumbling into a
wall where he then collapsed, immobile.</p>
<p>&quot;Underhanded villain...&quot;</p>
<p>But only the wind answered him — the villain gripping the bloodied censor said not a word.</p>
<p>&quot;...The person you're looking for is in the barren mountains beyond this village... Go seek your death there...&quot;</p>
<p>But the villain had departed, and all that remained to answer him was the rustling the wind...</p>
<p>And the crackling of wild flames.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-6"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-6">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>Jin the Seventy-Second waited till the rainbow had dispersed before setting off once from Tupi Village toward the barren
mountains. Ancient legend held that these batten mountains had been brought into being by slices from the Celestial
Emperor's blade, and thus were incredibly hard to scale. Folk tales also held that they were called barren, for they had
soaked up the tears of the Earth Mother, and thus had become bitterly salty lands where nothing grew.</p>
<p>The barren mountains had once been mined for gold and gems, but the mines had all been ruined in an earthquake, their
workers buried within. No one tried ever again to create the facilities to mine the mountain's bounty, and its caverns
were infested with wicked beasts and bandits.</p>
<p>And among these evils hidden in the mountains was Jin the Seventy-Second's nemesis. The swordsman's shoulders shivered,
and his gait hesitant, for the wounds he had been given in the battle against the chief of Tupi Village hindered him
still.</p>
<p>He knew that many pairs of eyes stared out at him from between the wither rocks, and the breath of beasts who had caught
the scents of hid blood was all around. Long years of bloodshed had honed Jin the Seventy-Second's senses to their
limit.</p>
<p>He sensed that the lifeless mountains were in fact a giant death trap. Bandits and villains lay in wait for him to enter
some narrow grotto, or squeeze into a tiny gorge, or pass by a collapsed mine shaft. Then, they would set upon him in
the darkness with knives, and finish him.</p>
<p>But from the looks of things now, the steep mountains now looked like they might be able to kill Jin the Seventy-Second.
The swordsman limped with every step he took, and the road was small and treacherous. Every so often, gravel would slip
loose beneath his feet.</p>
<p>At the same time, upon a cliff twisted about with sinuous, dead trees, two figures squinted as they observed the tiny
wanderer.</p>
<p>&quot;He has been worse for wear since he departed from the mountain's base. If we but leave him to the treacherous trek, he
will surely fall into the abyss below.&quot; So said a bone-thin old crone.</p>
<p>She glanced to her side, icy death in her jade-blue eyes, sharp as a viper hidden in a rocky cleft.</p>
<p>&quot;Not so!&quot; She turned to face the booming voice of a corpulent old man. &quot;He slew three hundred and sixty-two at Tupi
Village, and even cooked the dog at the gate for stew. &quot;Though he may have been badly wounded by the village chief to
the point where he can barely move, we should still beware of him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmph...&quot; The old woman vanished into the withered forest with a displeased noise.</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot; The old man watched a while longer as the lame swordsman stopped for a moment more, before patting his large belly
and slowly departed. Not a single withered tree or blade of dying grass was touched as he did.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the sky turned dark with gathering stormclouds, and mordant rain again began to fall lightly. In the
mountain rain, the wounded Jin the Seventy-Second leaned on his sword like a crutch, and struggled forward. But the
chilling cold and the loss of blood was too much for him to bear, and he fell upon the gravel and barren stone.</p>
<p>Just as the darkness took him, he caught a glimpse of the billowing hem of azure-blue skirts... He could've sworn he'd
seen that sight before.</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-pressing-official-businesses"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-pressing-official-businesses">Volume 1: Pressing Official Businesses</a></h2>
<p>&quot;I am the Great and Glorious General Weiyang, emissary of the imperial court on a royal mission! I demand that you step
aside at once!&quot; &quot;General? So the Great and Glorious is a military rank now, huh? I thought it was a civil office.&quot; Mir
responded with not a moment's hesitation. Weiyang's face turned bright red. &quot;Oh!? An ignorant borderland heathen seeks
to educate me on the matters of the court!?&quot; Mir was unfazed. &quot;I would be surprised if they'd overhauled the entire
government bureaucracy in the space of a few years.&quot; Two broad-sword-wielding Martial Artists in Weiyang's party burst
out laughing. &quot;Haha! So it ends our grand journey to the capital... The cart finally makes it past a thousand miles of
checkpoints, only to get gridlocked like this at some tiny little inn out in the wilderness!&quot; Qin stared intently at
Weiyang's crimson-colored cheeks before suddenly declaring: &quot;You're a woman! A female officer disguised as a man!&quot; The
claim was accentuated with a prod of his finger. &quot;An astute observation,&quot; came the response from one of the martial
artists. &quot;She is in fact the Secretary of Ceremonies. The two of us are military officers. One from the Imperial Guards,
the other from the Imperial Escorts, both versed in polearm and sword. We are serving the office of the Imperial Grand
Minister on secondment, and we are here under orders to retrieve the Ominous Swords.&quot; &quot;Although the part about the Great
and Glorious Gen... General, haha... Although that's made up, the bit about being here on official court... uh, business
is not,&quot; the other Martian Artist chimed in to say.</p>
<p>The Ominous Swords were something that Mir had heard of. The story was that an iron meteorite had fallen from the sky
five or six years ago, and convention dictated that as nature's treasure it belonged to the imperial family. However, a
swordsmith by the name of Feng had taken it for himself and used it to illegaly cast nine swords. It was said that the
Ominous Swords were cursed by the meteorite and could drain people's intellect. Naturally, they had caused quite the
stir in martial artists' circles.</p>
<p>&quot;Good for you,&quot; said Mir as he shut the toilet door. &quot;It'd be even better for me if you got yourself out from that
toilet... now!&quot; Her disguise exposed, Weiyang gave up trying to compose herself and spoke in her normal voice. She
sounded more charming than one would expect, given the circumstances. &quot;Officer Weiyang is a cultured lady of the court.
Unlike us, she cannot resolve her pressing official business by simply finding a discrete spot in the wild. Please,
hurry up!&quot;</p>
<p>Mir washed his hands and exited the toilet, then sat down at the table with the two Martial Artists. &quot;it is not at every
border town that we encounter one so familiar with court affairs.&quot; The one that seems to be the Imperial Escort officer
sizes up Mir. &quot;Might I inquire as to your personal history?&quot; &quot;My father, Mi Tingren, was Minister of Imperial Banquets.
He was framed for embezzlement of funds intended for the imperial cuisine. He then resigned from his post and returned
home.&quot; Mir paused to scratch his chin before continuing, &quot;My old man's not been himself ever since that happened. I
still intend to go back to the court one day and clear the Mi family name.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-a-matter-of-possession"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-a-matter-of-possession">Volume 2: A Matter of Possession</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Yum. Very nice.&quot; Now that the spirit had possessed her body, Weiyang was of a much sweeter and gentler disposition. She
took a tiny bite of one of Mir's stuffed pies, but it was too hot, so in an effort to avoid burning her tongue she stuck
it out of her mouth and panted for breath frantically. Truth be told, it was all rather cute. &quot;That came unexpectedly. I
need some time to process.&quot; Mir, who had given up one of his eyeballs to appease the spirit, helped himself to a pie and
asked, &quot;Can you go over it again?&quot; &quot;Very well. The 'meteorite' was in fact a Divine Halberd. It was snapped into pieces
by a commoner and made into nine cursed swords — the Ominous Swords. This one is the Sword of Mist, adding in that pair
I've found three of them to date.&quot; &quot;And what's your place in all of this?&quot; &quot;I was once the daughter of the Celestial
Emperor. But I have long forgotten my name. I was in charge of conducting trials and sentencing at the end — a judge, to
use your parlance.&quot; Since the Court of Imperial Entertainments was responsible for sacrifices and offerings, Mir's
father had forced him to learn every last detail and word uttered in every known court ritual. And because most rituals
involved encounters with bizarre forces and temperamental deities, he also knew a thing or two about how to deal with
them. For instance, he knew that deities tended to guard their names closely, for knowledge of a deity's true name
allows a human being to exercise absolute control over them. So he wasn't convinced this one had simply forgotten her
name.</p>
<p>&quot;So the court wants to retrieve the swords to reconstruct the Divine Halberd?&quot; Mir forced himself to entertain the
reasonability of this line of inquiry. &quot;I don't know. The master of this body knows nothing else. She is just... deeply
angry. She wants to prove herself.&quot; Weiyang puts her hands on her chest. &quot;So what's the next step? Do I have to perform
some sort of farewell ceremony for you?&quot; Mir stroked the bandaged and sightless eye. &quot;And then do I get my eye back?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give me a name.&quot; She raised her head, oblivious to the crumbs at the edges of her mouth. &quot;Don't be ridiculous. The
imperial civil service examinations are overseen in person by the Emperor himself. How will I claim the title of
Minister of Imperial Banquets with only one eye?&quot; &quot;Well, I have things to reclaim too: the remaining pieces of the
Divine Halberd,&quot; she responded. &quot;Otherwise, this world and everything in it is going to burn in hellfire.&quot; Mir kept
looking at her, but did not respond. &quot;You do not need to go with me. But with the fate of all living things at stake,
please allow me to hold on to your eyeball for the time being.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-a-dark-westward-journey"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-a-dark-westward-journey">Volume 3: A Dark Westward Journey</a></h2>
<p>&quot;This is all that I can do fo you,&quot; Mir said as he placed a series of dishes onto the table. He then sat down opposite
Weiyang. Weiyang's right arm, which was broken in the fight to the death that had just taken place, was still wrapped in
bandages. She stared intensely at Mir for a long while, but Mir just sat there resting his jaw on his hand and looking
downards. Neither of them spoke. Finally, Weiyang attempted to use chopsticks with her left hand. But alas, her
dexterity was found wanting, and she failed to procure a single meatball from the murky depths of the hot broth. Mir
sighed, took the chopsticks from her hand, and said, &quot;Fine, I'll feed you.&quot; &quot;So there is still more that you can do for
me,&quot; Weiyang suddenly quipped a few mouthfuls in. Her mood remained unchanged. &quot;The Court of Imperial Entertainments is
dedicated to worshiping and making sacrifices to all you divine beings up above. Serving you is my family's job.&quot; And in
any case, when the gods make their move, what can mere mortals do but look on helplessly and accept their fate? — At
least, that's what Mir thought. But he also thought it was better to keep that part to himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Couldn't you use your powers, though? I thought you said that each time you fight a Omnious Sword owner, you use
telekinesis to make your polearm levitate, swing your sword around, and so on. Surely chopsticks can't be any harder?&quot;
&quot;That is a power bestowed upon me by my father. Only I have this power. It is solely for use in sentencing the guilty. I
mustn't...&quot; Weiyang's voice changed in tone. &quot;I mustn't use it lightly.&quot; &quot;Before he died, that guy said something really
strange about the situation with my father.&quot; Mir flicked the candle flame while he spoke to relieve his boredom.
&quot;'Minister Mi was neither innocent, nor wrongly accused.' What on earth did he mean by that?&quot; If the court was unwilling
to reconstruct the Divine Halberd, then being with the celestial emperor's daughter that had possessed Weiyang's body
makes him an enemy of the imperial court. As if to signal that she had understood what Mir was thinking, Weiyang's face
grew dark in the candlelight. She said, &quot;You don't need to help me any longer. Your are a mere mortal, there is nothing
to be gained from settling a score with the court.&quot; Mir replied, &quot;Speak no more of this matter, I must get the truth out
of my old man first.&quot; Weiyang said, &quot;Oh.. we will pay a visit to your esteemed father? Then I must buy some fresh silk
garmets and makeup first thing tomorrow morning.&quot; Mir replied, &quot;He's just a regular old man. There's no neeed for all
that.&quot; An unusually stern expression appeared on Weiyang's face. &quot;Is this not your sworn duty?&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-master-plan"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-master-plan">Volume 4: Master Plan</a></h2>
<p>Even a Buddha or an adeptus would have found themselves powerless to do anything in this situation. &quot;This is the Sword
of Flame, the 'Katakugosha.' It was made from the shard of the Divine Halberd that was the Dharani of the fire realm.
Sorry... in language that your Majesty would understand, it's made with the runes of the fire realm, one of the God
King's nine realms.&quot; How could this westbound warrior display such mastery of the sword? Most who had been stripped of
the intellect by an Ominous Sword lose their fighting instinct and any martial arts they had learned. Weiyang nursed her
broken arm and panted in the scorching hot air. Normally her abilities would enable her to fix broken bones, but the
unquenchable flames burnt relentlessly at her wound. Her sight grew blurry as she lost blood. Mir stepped in from of
her, guarding her from the warrior. &quot;I can see that would have a lot of questions. Fine, I'll tell you everything! I
killed your father because he tried to stop the resurrection of the God King. And the reason I can manipulate the fire
realm runes rather than the other way round is because...&quot; The warrior from the east raised the Ominous Sword. &quot;Is
because I am a warrior of Hunt From Above made flesh...&quot; Legend has it that the Celestial Emperor once went to war with
the Asura. To prepare for the war, the Celestial Emperor selected soldiers from three realms and made them ascend to
become his celestial army after death. Sometimes, they were best by inclement weather on the marsh, with thundercloud
tornados surrounding them. The people of Zhongzhou referred to it as the soldiers of the celestial army &quot;hunting from
above.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No... Impossible!&quot; A look of disbelief appeared on the warrior's face as the Ominous Sword broke into pieces, and he,
too, was sent flying from his own soldiers towards whatever destiny had in store for him next. In the chaos, Mir hand
brought out the sword his father had left him as inheritance. It was intended as more of a gesture of defiance than a
genuine attempt to fight back. But unbeknownst to him, this was the greatest cursed sword of all, that had once burned
the entire world to cinders: Laevatain. If the fire-realm runes constituted the mystery of the fire realm, Laevatain was
its pure unadulterated, unquenchable reality. The sword had extinguished after the world was burned, but having
assimilated the rune of the fire realm, it burned bright once more.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole world... destroyed again...&quot; Weiyang fell unconscious as she spoke.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-legacy-of-a-goddess"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-legacy-of-a-goddess">Volume 5: Legacy of a Goddess</a></h2>
<p>Your deeds have saved the people. You are indeed a great warrior.&quot; The crown prince, hands clasped behind his back,
walked in circles around Mir, who lay prostrate on the ground. But Mir was unmoved by his words. &quot;Hand over the Divine
Halberd and you may have the title of Minister of Imperial Banquets. Grand Secretary will be yours too within a decade,
if you want it.&quot; The crown prince sat down. &quot;Well? What is your response?&quot; &quot;A lowly commoner dares not speak till His
Majesty permits him to rise.&quot; &quot;Hmm... but now if I granted you permission to speak, it would be because you instructed
me to do so... We can't have that! As future lord of all the land—&quot; &quot;Pff. What a charade this is,&quot; said Mir as he
switched to a more relaxed position. &quot;The official etiquette of the ruling dynasty does not require kowtowing for an
audience with the crown prince. It should just be the regular thrice greeting. I noticed that you were on track to
become Emperor, so I thought I'd come pay my respects. There's just no need to lord it over me like this.&quot; &quot;You...
you...&quot; &quot;What about me?&quot; Mir snapped as he stood up. &quot;I will give you half of the Divine Halberd. The Dharani of the
fire realm, I will offer to father. Mostly to avoid another situation where we have remnants trying to stir up trouble.&quot;
&quot;Can't, uh, can't hurt. As long as the portion I get looks the part it'll be fine. This is gonna be known as the new
national superweapon! Hahaha...&quot; Mir sat down impatiently right in front of the crown prince. &quot;I don't understand how
you are such a fool when we were both raised under the same mother's milk!&quot; &quot;How dare you! I have nothing but respect
for Lady Mi serving as my wet nurse. And it's only because of the virtues she instilled in me that I am able to put up
with your—&quot; &quot;Give the title of Minister of Imperial Banquets to someone who cares. I'm going home.&quot; The crown prince
said nothing. &quot;How about Weiyang?&quot; Mir chewed his food and acted nonchalant. &quot;Oh, for the meritous act of retrieving the
swords, she was promoted to Secretary of Ceremonies. She was not implicated in the evil plot by her father, the Imperial
Grand Minister. The Minister of Ceremonies and the Grand Secretary both testified. I will see her every need is met.&quot;
Something sounded odd about that. But that was fine.</p>
<p>She was gone, and his eye was restored. But to this day there was still a dull ache, like the phantom pain of a missing
limb.</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-nothingness"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-nothingness">Volume 6: Nothingness</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Oh my daughter, the one in whom all my hopes are placed! Did I not bring you into existence that you might one day
pierce me with a halberd?&quot; Awakened at last, the God King floated in the heavens to the claps of thunder and the dancing
of the wind, rejoicing at his return.</p>
<p>But she was no longer afraid. This was the moment she had been waiting for her entire life, the moment she had been made
for all those eons ago. No — that was not it. The true source of her courage was the time she had spent with him.</p>
<p>The first Divine Halberd, Irmin, once pierced the Axis Mundi and connected the nine worlds. Now, its replicas had
proliferated across the heavens.</p>
<p>Fearing the madness that would ensue following his death, the God King made one final Divine Halberd, and named it the
Prinzessin der Verurteilung. In this moment, it — nay, she — could finally unleash her true self.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A commentary from the editor appears at the end of the book:</p>
<p>Legend of the Shattered Halberd was a successful first attempt by Inazuma's Yae Publishing House to incorporate elements
of Liyue culture in one of their novels. The first five volumes were wildly successful, becoming something of a cultural
phenomenon in both Inazuma and Liyue. Commercially, the fact that a sixth volume exists at all speaks to its success. I
trust that the abrupt finale to this epic saga brought by volume six will not be to our readers' displeasure. I hope.</p>
<p>Though the ending reads like a different story entirely, I must stress that this did not arise from any attempt on our
part to pressurize Mr. Nine, the author, into developing material for a new series. The truth is that in his rush to
meet the publishing schedule, Mr. Nine ended up diverging somewhat from his usual style. Mr. Nine simply wished to
challenge himself as a writer. ♡</p>
<p>Naturally, we are sympathetic to the fans of the original First Five volumes. In this spirit, we would like to announce
that a special First Five collector's edition, the Blackwood Box Set, is currently in the making. Those who have grown
up reading Legend of the Shattered Halberd in bookstores: this is the time to finally buy it for yourself! Also, expect
to hear more tales of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung in the future.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Commerce and trade, like springs and streams, begin with the mountains and end with the seas. The penchant of people is
to pursue profit, and when people turn their means to profitable ends, wealth is created. To possess means is to possess
power, and to curb the unjust excesses of power, we restrain it with contracts to guide all things to prosper together.
The strong should not bully the weak, nor should weakness be despised and strength glorified. Let it be known to all
that trade and commerce allows the river of gold to flow unimpeded along its natural course — this is the just and
upright way.</p>
<p>Some say: &quot;There are those who lose their jobs and have no reliable source of food, nor a roof over their heads, they
toil in vain in their barren fields. All the while, the wealthy merchants' residences overflow with gold and jade. What
justice and uprightness is this?&quot;</p>
<p>This question is devoid of insight. Like the waves that face off against the golden sands of the shoreline, the pursuit
of profit topples much of what stands in its way, and like the rapids that run in the valleys, it is unrelenting. Thus
those in poverty will not stay poor forever, just as the wealthy shall not hold onto their riches for eternity — but the
treasury must always be filled for the nation to remain peaceful and prosperous.</p>
<p>Hence, it is the proper way of things to eschew prohibition, expand the economy, and reform the government. It is easy
to succumb to complacency in the matter of aid, but this must not become the trend and should be curtailed. The
Millelith should be expanded to pacify unrest, both the bandits at our borders and the citizens who reside within them.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Though Rex Lapis enjoys immortality, mortals require provisions and preparation to be free of worry. This grand plan
charts the course that will lead us, slowly but surely, to Liyue's longevity and the people's prosperity. The task of
reform is one that should be undertaken with patience, we cannot make rash, demands lest we overlook other concerns.
Just as one who carves by candlelight patiently waits for the jade to take shape, so will it take time for the myriad
affairs of Liyue to be gradually settled.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="moonlit-bamboo-forest"><a class="header" href="#moonlit-bamboo-forest">Moonlit Bamboo Forest</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-12"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-12">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>Between the rustling emerald curtain of foliage, in a spot where the croak of frogs and shrills of cicadas meet, lies a
corner of the forest that is withered and dry, just near the wetlands beneath the mountain crags.</p>
<p>The bamboo forest of Mt. Qingce is the verdant home to many fables.</p>
<p>After a spell of rain, a cadence of drips and drops can be heard bouncing from the bamboo leaves and hollow bamboo
stalks. Along a winding path between the bamboo spires came a young boy. He swiftly made his way along the trail,
climbing up damp crags and running down its paved mossy course. The leaves of tangled foliage and vines strewn across
his path brushed against his skin. The boy finally decided to stop for a rest at a dried and withering spot among the
creaking bamboo of Mt. Qingce, tucked away below the mountain rock.</p>
<p>The boy clearly remembered the village elder once saying that the rainy season was the proper time for the fox to take
its fox wife. Only eyes of a child could ever see the fox bride's crimson sedan chair and its procession dancing through
the forest accompanied by strains of music and thumping drums.</p>
<p>The village elder also warned that kids mustn't approach near any such procession.</p>
<p>&quot;If you wander too close, the fox will snatch your soul away!&quot; That's what the village elder always said.</p>
<p>&quot;What happens if your soul gets snatched?&quot; asked one of the kids.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the fox has your soul, your fate will be forever sealed... Perhaps they will use you for music in their
processions, smashing you like a cymbal and beating you like a drum, horns blaring all around... There will be no rest
for your soul.&quot;</p>
<p>The elder would never forget to pose as if she were beating a drum, scaring all the little ones.</p>
<p>As the boy grew older, he stopped believing the elder's silly fables. Following the Seelie's wispy trails, he passed
through the green labyrinth, accompanied by the faint calls of foxes coming from the thickets along the way. Those
crafty creatures hiding deep in the forest will seldom reveal themselves or their boisterous bridal processions to
careless treading travelers.</p>
<p>The boy was feeling quite low in spirit, kicking pebbles off the road and stomping up the seemingly unnatural stairways
along the way, wandering further into the heart of the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>The village elder once said that this very forest was once an ancient kingdom conquered by the Geo Archon. But what did
the Geo Archon look like? Did it have arms and legs, or eyes like us? Or, was he more like the stone beasts found along
the water banks?</p>
<p>The herb gatherers that periodically set up shop in the city to sell their herbal ingredients would always bring tales
of the year's Rite of Descension. Listening to their stories, one could only imagine the amazing scene of the Geo Archon
descending to the world. But of course, the curious kids could only hope to someday see the great Archon that had been
revered for generations with their very own eyes.</p>
<p>Was the immovable Mt. Qingce a gift from the benevolent Geo Archon? Or were the decades of peaceful living that which
had already been ordained by the Archon?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions lay outside the village, within the aging forest on the mountain.</p>
<p>Bubbling with questions and expectation, the determined boy made his way forward beneath the scattered shadows of bamboo
leaves.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-11"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-11">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>Lost among the green bamboo canopy, the young lad soon met an unexpected companion.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter? Are you lost?&quot; The lad heard a gentle voice among the rustling bamboo stalks, speaking with a hint
of sarcastic playfulness.</p>
<p>The lad turned to see a slender woman garbed in white. She stood beside a clear babbling brook, with beads of water
glistening on her woven rush raincoat, her golden eyes melding with the rays cast through the forest by the setting sun.</p>
<p>The village elder had said that there were once white horses that would leap from clear springs to become adepti to
assist the campaigns of the Lord of Geo. But no one had ever specified which spring, or the honorable name of the
illuminated beast that sprang from it. Besides, the woman that stood before him now didn't appear to be an adeptus,
apart from the piercing gaze of her golden eyes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he had never heard of any adepti that needed to wear raincoats.</p>
<p>&quot;Well if it isn't another fool.&quot; The lady garbed in white began to chuckle, squinting her eyes with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you calling a fool!&quot; Replied the young lad in a fluster. This was certainly no adeptus. Who could have heard of
an adeptus that would speak in such a deplorable manner?</p>
<p>&quot;I embark on an adventure. I wish to be a sail across the seas and witness the stone spears of the Lord of Geo for
myself!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've only just embarked on your journey and yet you've already fallen astray among the bamboo forest...&quot; The woman's
reply was calm and even, her eyes making a subtle smirk. The lad already found her particularly annoying.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't need your...&quot; &quot;There's no shame in being lost. Come, follow me. I will lead out of here.&quot; The woman snickered
and extended her slender hand toward the boy. Her white skin glimmered under the rays of the sunset that shone between
the bamboo leaves.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, thank you...&quot; The young lad took her outstretched hand. Her skin was cold and damp to the touch, much like fresh
rain upon a mountain or dewdrops upon a bamboo shoot.</p>
<p>The setting sun gradually fell behind the mountain ridge, and the afterglow in the clear above gradually began to
darken.</p>
<p>The village elder said that once the warm glow of the setting sun fades, the spirit of the mountain woods becomes a cold
and murky breeding ground for monsters. These monsters are born from a past that has long gone, their spirits forming
from the resentment and unwillingness of the dead. Any bamboo they ensnare by them will dry up and die, and any person
they ensnare will similarly grow weary and fade from existence. &quot;Sometimes, they will even call upon passersby to assist
them with matters that they could not accomplish on their own, before leading them into a trap from which they would
never return...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Other times, they would act as a guide for innocent travelers, leading them to a den of demons.&quot; &quot;So you see, little
ones, you must stay vigilant, and never let your guard down when you journey far from familiar soil.&quot; Thus said the
village elder, patting the kids on their heads as she finished the story.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, could this woman in white be a monster of the mountain woods? The lad grew nervous in his heart and
couldn't help but slow his pace.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; The woman turned around, her golden eyes shining through the moonlight draping over her silhouette.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-8"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-8">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Nightfall seemed to always hasten its approach over the bamboo forest of Mt. Qingce. Gazing upward, the silvery
moonlight was scattered amidst the shadows of the bamboo forest's leaves. In a spot illuminated under the moonlight, far
from the croaking frogs and chirping cicadas, new bamboo culms had just sprouted from the ground.</p>
<p>The bamboo forest of Mt. Qingce is the verdant home to many fables.</p>
<p>As night fell, the woman garbed in white began to recount many stories to the young lad, ancient tales that the lad had
never heard before.</p>
<p>&quot;Long ago, three bright moons once hung high in the night sky. These three moons were sisters, their years numbering
more than that of the Geo Archon and their year of birth dating before the very bedrock upon which Liyue Harbor now
rests. The moons were daughters of prose and song, sovereign over the night sky. They navigated the heavens above in
their silver carriage, alternating with one another thrice a month. If the reign was not promptly passed from one sister
to the next, a terrible disaster would occur that very day. These three luminous moons shared but one love, the stars of
daybreak. Only at the fleeting moments when day and night converged could one of the three sisters pass the fading stars
and gaze upon the chambers of the morning stars. Moments later, as the new dawn would break over the horizon, the
carriage would quickly ferry the night's sister away. The three sisters shared an equal affection for their one and only
love, much like the affection they shared for one another. But this was all before the world was smashed against the
tides of great calamity. With time, disasters overturned the sovereign carriage and laid ruin to the halls of the stars.
The three sisters of the night turned against one another, leading to their eternal parting by death. Only one of their
pale corpses now remains, ever shedding its cold light...&quot;</p>
<p>The woman raised her head and gazed at the moon though the sea of bamboo. Her long, slender neck was covered in the
silver light and her eyes shone gold.</p>
<p>&quot;The wolf packs are children of the moons, they remember the calamities and the tragedies that ensued. Hence, they
lament the fate of their mother with each new moon... It is also why those who live among the wolves call the morning
stars, the surviving love of the moon, the grievous stars.&quot; &quot;I see...&quot; The young lad remained silent for some time. This
was a story that the village elders had never told them before. Perhaps it was a legend that even the eldest of elders
had never heard before. Such stories were much more grand than those about foxes taking brides and monsters ensnaring
people, but less riveting than the tales of the Lord of Geo driving away evil spirits. The woman's tales were almost
like a dream of the imagination.</p>
<p>&quot;These are stories that have never been told, legends that have already been long forgotten by people.&quot; The woman garbed
in white gently stroked the lad's hair and lowered her eyelids. The golden color of her eyes darkened a bit. &quot;Before the
ancient immortals established the universe, there were gods that wandering across the lands. It was at this time that
many of the adepti came into being. But what about before then? Only broken memories and fragments of the past were
turned into stories, and stories turned into legends, passed down among the people... Even deities and adepti alike
would feel sentimental upon hearing such ancient memories that surpass the mortal world.</p>
<p>The woman gave a long sigh and turned to find the young lad fast asleep. &quot;Tsk! Unbelievable...&quot; With a helpless smile,
she took off her raincoat and placed it over the young lad.</p>
<p>That night, the lad dreamt of three moons in the sky, and a silver carriage stopped before the gates of the stars.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-7"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-7">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>As day, slowly dawned, the young boy was gently awakened.</p>
<p>Daybreak's light silhouetted the white mist that shrouded the bamboo forest of which tales of ghostly foxes were told,
and they seemed like horsetails as they billowed this way and that.</p>
<p>The woman held his hand, and together they walked toward the place where the sun pierced through the woods. They turned
left, then right, passing through undergrowth teeming with insects, clambering over slippery moss-covered stones,
scaling down a gorge hidden by the shadows of the bamboo trees. All the way she led him, till they arrived at the exit
of the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>&quot;I still don't know who you are, or where you're from.&quot; Said the boy, for the previous night's story had yet to leave
his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot; The woman turned, and with her back to the morning light, her eyes shone gold. But she merely smiled, and said
nothing.</p>
<p>Many years later, the boy who was a boy no longer would remember that moment, and he would understand: the gap between
them was as a yawning chasm. His fate was to leave his home and go to Liyue Harbor, to seek the riches the Geo Archon
had bestowed upon him. Hers, then, was to hide herself away, away from the majestic, kindly gaze of that great Lord of
Geo, and protect those ancient tales that even she was beginning to forget.</p>
<p>So, the boy and the white-clad, golden-eyed woman were parted. He would pack his things and head for that thriving port
city, while she stood silently at the boundaries of the bamboo forest. For in her bewitching eyes she seemed to have
already foreseen the young man's fate–that someday, when he was old, tired of the sea and the waves of life, he would
slowly return to this mountain village, and there he would live out the rest of his days.</p>
<p>In the dawn's glow, the boy heard a whinnying cry that then grew distant. He turned and looked, and there was nothing
behind him, but a single strand of hair that had come to rest on his shoulder.</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-stone-beasts"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-stone-beasts">Volume 1: Stone Beasts</a></h2>
<p>Stone statues appear all across the vast land of Liyue. Most were built by locals who prayed to them for favorable
weather and peace steadfast as the mountains. But it is claimed that some have a much more ancient history.</p>
<p>One story regarding the animal statues in particular is popular among the fishermen of the Bishui River, the Silvergrass
harvesters of Dihua Marsh, and the old mining crowd. They say that in some corners of the land, ancient stone beasts
wake at night in the cool of the fall and look around at a world that has slowly become alien to them. Hearing the
sounds of frogs and insects greeting them, they respond with deep, soulful cries from their petrified throats. Then they
roam around Liyue, inspecting once more the land they used to protect.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, no one has ever witnessed a stone beast in motion firsthand. However, local residents who know the
territory extremely well have long observed and accepted the phenomenon that the animal statues can change location and
posture overnight. Meanwhile, light-sleeping campers often report hearing a sound in the middle of the night that is
like flowing water, only much deeper in tone.</p>
<p>As for where these stone beasts originally came from, the elders of Qingce Village say they are illuminated beasts who
once fought alongside Rex Lapis in the Archon War. After the war ended, the tide subsided and peace was restored. The
illuminated beasts were no longer required to serve as defenders of the common people, and one by one they retreated to
more secluded parts of the country. There they lived free from concern for mortal affairs.</p>
<p>But some illuminated beasts remembered with fondness the glorious days when they served under Rex Lapis, and they pined
for the years when they protected Liyue. Though they were not of the mortal realm, nor were they immortal: For them,
too, life would one day come to an end. Thus, they beseeched Rex Lapis to turn their ephemeral flesh bodies into
everlasting stone. The merciful Geo Archon granted their request and made them as such.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-palace-beneath-the-sea"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-palace-beneath-the-sea">Volume 2: Palace Beneath the Sea</a></h2>
<p>The day had arrived. It was time to collect the bride.</p>
<p>The Sea God looked majestic indeed as he sat center stage in his giant clam, holding in his hands the reins of two sea
serpents. They stood as imposing as Mt. Tianheng before the royal carriage as their master accepted the gifts of pearls
from the village elders and welcomed his new bride aboard the carriage. In return, the village would receive the Sea
God's blessing: a year free from tempests and tsunamis.</p>
<p>The bride was whisked away to a place deep beneath the waves, far from home, far from the reveling crowds celebrating
the festival, and far from her mother all alone. The Sea God took her along a corridor of great columns, formed from the
skeleton of a dead whale, that led to a palatial gate adorned with shining pearls and iridescent shells. Finally, the
young bride had arrived at the palace the Sea God had made for her. The palace that was to be her new home.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not my plan to meddle in the affairs of common people,&quot; came the god's voice rippling through the water. It was
a husband's attempt to console his bride.</p>
<p>&quot;This place has served as a new home for many other young women, and it also became the place they spent their final
days. Many of them were driven away from the village where they were born. For them, the ocean had provided safe refuge.
Somewhere they could sleep peacefully without fear of being disturbed. Somewhere they could call home.&quot;</p>
<p>But this young woman did not want a new home decorated with prize pearls and rare shells. The dazzling spectacle of the
ocean floor — and the creatures that she knew lurked in the darkness — filled her not with peace, but with dread. Time
went by, and the longer she stayed in her bewildering ocean chamber that knew not sunrise nor sunset, the more homesick
she grew — and the frailer she became.</p>
<p>Eventually, there came a day when the Sea God sensed what his young bride was feeling. Though saddened by her choice, he
allowed her to go through with her decision.</p>
<p>&quot;In the fallen world of the humans, there will come a day in your life when you regret this decision.&quot; The Sea God took
the shell of a sea snail that adorned his waist and handed it to her as a parting gift.</p>
<p>&quot;There will come a day that you blow into this shell, and it will sound like a horn. On that day, you shall return to
this place.&quot;</p>
<p>The young woman took the shell and returned to the land. The years went by, and soon she became a mother herself. As she
went about her simple, peaceful life, the ocean palace seemed but a childhood dream. The dazzling sights and grotesque
creatures would once in a while flood into her mind from the murky depths of her memory, but it was a rare occurrence,
and she put them out of her mind. She lived like this year after year. Until one year, when the festival came once
again, the village elders came to her home. They had come to take her daughter from her arms. It was then that she
finally understood why the Sea God had spoken of her regret, and of her return, all those years ago.</p>
<p>On the eve of the festival, she blew into the shell, and it sounded like a horn.</p>
<p>The Sea God responded to the call, rising up from the billowing waves to greet the village. But his embrace was a tidal
wave that engulfed the village, and took the villagers and elders in their sleep. Drawn by giant sea serpents, a
colossal clam carriage came to a halt in front of her, dazzling her with its shimmering pearls. The mother took her
daughter by the hand and boarded the Sea God's clam. It was just like she remembered from her childhood — only this
time, the village she left behind now lay in ruins beneath the ocean waves.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-wuwang"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-wuwang">Volume 3: Wuwang</a></h2>
<p>Hiding between the jagged peaks in the north of Mt. Qingce is a slope known as Wuwang Hill, a palpably ominous place and
the setting of many tales of supernatural phenomena. It is rumored by Liyue that the spirits of the dead lurk within the
woods on Wuwang Hill. They roam the perimeter of the decrepit village, wandering among the withering trees and rotting
foliage, eternally yearning for things left unresolved in living years. These floating spirits often entice unsuspecting
passers-by away from the main path and onto treacherous mountain tracks that leads them tumbling into a river or
straight into an ambush of ravenous monsters.</p>
<p>It is this phenomenon from which Wuwang Hill derives its name. Wuwang means &quot;prudence&quot; in the common tongue, and Wuwang
Hill is said to be &quot;the hill where the prudent are punished.&quot; For even those travelers who do not act rashly or
impulsively on their journey are doomed to be ensnared by the malevolence that lingers here like the mist in the
mountain air.</p>
<p>Both innocent villagers and ignorant visitors alike are susceptible to the deception of the Wuwang Hill spirits, which
draw them deep into dark woods where thick mist blots out the sky and unknown dangers lurk in the shadows. There are
many means by which these sinister spirits are able to deceive mortals. Some take the form of bereavement or grief,
others of regret, manifesting as voices and visages of the deceased, the love of the departed, or the remorse of another
party in an unresolved dispute. The traveler finds themselves compelled to heed the spirit's cry, and follows them into
the depths of Wuwang.</p>
<p>But Wuwang Hill was not always this way. Some signs of life remained there up until relatively recently, and in times
gone by the village at the foot of the slope enjoyed a peaceful and leisurely existence, the chimneys always smoking and
the lanterns always lit. That same village stands abandoned today... The buildings are in ruins and all that remains of
the villagers is the indistinct murmuring from a realm beyond.</p>
<p>There is a fable that is oft-repeated among the children of Qingce Village. It holds that the young people of Wuwang
Hill, enchanted by the whale-like song of a faraway sea monster,[Note 1] all threw themselves into the gently flowing
Bishui River in pursuit of false promises and childlike dreams. Along the river they floated, making their way to the
Sea of Clouds, where they became one with the waves and lost all memory of the woods and their village on the hill...
Their dreams, meanwhile, became the sea monster's song. Generation after generation of young people disappeared in this
way, until in the end, the sole remaining residents of Wuwang Hill were old and gray. One by one, they left this mortal
plane amidst sighs of grief. The bright lights of Liyue Harbor, Rex Lapis's pride and joy, burned ever brighter, while
another neglected mountain village turned into a silent ghost town.</p>
<p>But unlike the fleeting and fickle human mind, the ever-flowing ley lines remember all. Surging elemental energy takes
on spirit form to recreate all the dreams, both fair and foul, of Wuwang Hill's erstwhile residents. Much like a mother
who once lost a child and now searches desperately through their irretrievable past for a way to bring everything back,
the ley lines — albeit unconsciously — repeatedly recreate the past and those who inhabited it. The way each looked, the
way each child cried, the way the elderly would sigh in their twilight years. Each moment of joy, and each moment of
sorrow. And like the hypnotic song of the great creature of the deep sea, it unintentionally lures toward it any
nostalgic soul who would dare trespass here.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-mountain-spirits"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-mountain-spirits">Volume 4: Mountain Spirits</a></h2>
<p>Many lone seelie are found floating in the mountain forests of Liyue. These glowing spirits are unfailingly found
hovering in the mountain mist, in the ruins of ancient cities, or in crumbling, decrepit villages. Should a
Vision-bearer draw near, the seelie will guide the way for them, leading them to long-hidden treasure or unfathomably
ingenious mechanisms.</p>
<p>The people of Liyue believe these tiny, silent spirits to be auspicious sightings, the souls either of departed adepti
or unnamed benevolent gods of old. Others believe they are the echoes of strangers without kin, lingering in the
mountains to guide lonely, lost visitors onto the path back home.</p>
<p>Another old legend told in the mountain villages claims that there was once a time, before the adepti had come into
being, when the seelie who meander in the mountains knew an altogether different existence, one in which they had
beautiful physical forms and possessed great wisdom. That era, when the seelie roamed the mountains and strolled through
the grand halls in the cities of old, is said to date back even further that the days when Rex Lapis fought bitterly
against countless rival gods.</p>
<p>At a far-flung moment in the distant past, the ancestor of the seelie met a traveler from afar, with whom they swore an
oath of union witnessed by the three sisters of the Lunar Palace. Just thirty days later, a sudden disaster struck. The
seelie and their lover fled into exile as the world collapsed around them, fleeing until the terrible calamity caught up
with and seized them. Their cruel punishment was to be separated from each other for eternity and to have their memories
wiped without a trace.</p>
<p>The graceful but heartbroken seelie and the sisters grew more sullen and withdrawn with each passing day, to the point
where their wondrous forms withered away, leaving fragments of their former selves scattered in the mountains and ruins,
where they turned into tiny little life forms. They had forgotten so much, lost so much, and been stripped of their
voices and wisdom, yet they continued to sing the same songs of grief. Because of this, still harboring a shred of the
deep love they once had for their long-lost lover, they will act as guides to travelers who stop in the mountain mist,
seeking to retrace their memories of an ancient story in long-abandoned ruins, disused makeup cabinets, and
now-undecipherable poetry.</p>
<p>Of course, these are nothing but clumsy, incoherent folk tales, wild and fantastical conjecture about what Liyue may
have been like in the distant past before the time of Rex Lapis. Needless to say, such tales have no credibility
whatsoever. The true origin of these sorrowful spirits that meander in the mountains is, however, still widely debated,
and no consensus has ever been reached on the topic.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-qilin"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-qilin">Volume 5: Qilin</a></h2>
<p>Among the legends that circulate in the mountains of Liyue, the qilin are a type of noble and benevolent illuminated
beast. Qilin often roam the mountain forests, but appear only on nights where starlight shines upon clear dew. For
sustenance, they drink only spring water and eat only fragrant herbs.</p>
<p>Qilin are gentle illuminated beasts, with grace and elegance flowing through their veins. It is said that qilin will
never harm living things, refusing even to step on an insect or break a blade of grass. People believe that a qilin's
characteristics, behavior, and their every movement is dictated by an age-old etiquette that has remained unchanged for
a thousand years.</p>
<p>Following the barbarous age of the Archon War, many adepti became unable to continue living among the clamorous world of
mortals. As a result, and under the direction of Rex Lapis, they withdrew themselves from society to live in seclusion
in the bamboo groves and mountains. No longer would they interfere in the human world, content instead to enjoy a realm
of mountains and water and pursue their own interests.</p>
<p>Yet some illuminated beasts there were that, over a thousand years of mortal cooperation, had cultivated deep
friendships with ordinary humans. They decided to carry out the will of the Lord of Geo in the mortal realm, assisting
human society with their adeptal powers and charity. Some hid in mountain hamlets, others walked the bustling city
streets. They lived together and mixed with humankind, leaving behind unique bloodlines in Liyue Harbor.</p>
<p>According to one folktale, as early as several thousand years ago, there were already those among the elegant qilin who
had begun to grow deeply attached to the savage mortals.</p>
<p>The tale tells of how in that barbaric era, the people wore clothes of water lotus and bay leaf.</p>
<p>One night, a herb gatherer was bathing in a mountain pool, when to his surprise, a passing qilin began to eat the
clothes that he had left by the water's edge. The illuminated beast was too young to understand human notions of shame
and privacy and had yet to learn the conduct of illuminated beasts in the mortal realm.</p>
<p>To make up for her crude behavior and to avoid startling the vulnerable mortal with her otherworldly adeptal appearance,
she transformed into one of human bearing. As the pale light of the full moon fell onto the pool, she appeared before
the herb gatherer.</p>
<p>The young illuminated beast ultimately did not understand human notions of shame and privacy. She stood in that mountain
forest, lit by cold moonlight and the glow of fireflies, clothed only in dewdrops and the lunar gleam. Together with the
ignorant mortal she traveled, strolling happily among flowers and bamboo groves, revealing to him the mountain dwelling
of the adepti, interpreting for him the language of the birds, sleeping lightly amid the cry of insects, sinking softly
into shared and ancient dreams...</p>
<p>As the herb gatherer began to stir at the first light of dawn, he awoke to find that the noble illuminated beast had
vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>As for how this tale unfolds, opinions vary widely. Some people say that one night, the qilin placed a bamboo basket
outside the front door of the herb gatherer's home, before disappearing into the moonlit mist. When the herb gatherer
came to the door, he found a child soundly asleep inside the basket.</p>
<p>Others say that from that moment on the qilin lived together with the mortal, gave birth to children, and grew
accustomed to human life.</p>
<p>No matter the truth of the thousand-year-old matter, the elegant illuminated beasts continue to walk among the residents
of Liyue, unseen among the sea of people, waiting for the day when Rex Lapis calls them forth once again.</p>

<p>In the valley northwest of Liyue Harbor and south of Nantianmen lie many silent, ancient ruins.</p>
<p>One of these areas is known as the Dunyu Ruins. This area is said to have already existed even before the time of the
Archon Wars.</p>
<p>According to old legends passed by word of mouth, &quot;Dunyu&quot; means &quot;the land to which beauteous jade flees.&quot;[Note 2]</p>
<p>In a past beyond memory, when even Rex Lapis would still have been young, a star fell from the sky into the barren
plains west of Liyue. These plains were transformed into a huge and deep chasm in the wake of that star's descent, and
jade would emerge from within, beautiful and limitless, and it would become the foundation for a thousand years of
industrial mining in Liyue thereafter.</p>
<p>Legend has it that when that nameless star fell, a fragment of it broke off and crashed into the rocks in northern
Lisha.</p>
<p>As most know, wordless stones harbored soul and spirit, and in manners and times not witnessed by mortal eyes they
watched and listened to the ley lines' pulses, the echoes of the alpine springs, and the slow but inexorable movements
of the mountains.</p>
<p>But unlike the ordinary but enduring stone of the earth, the fragments of the meteorite that fell from heaven had a
proud and agitated temper.</p>
<p>Later, when countless gods and rulers fought over the appointed celestial seats, and the very stars and abyss themselves
faded, tragedy and evil embarred the breath of the waters and mountains. The fallen star could bear this no longer, and
heedless of the great chasm's persuasions to stay it leaped away, away towards the heavens.</p>
<p>As it returned to the skies, the heavenly jade left behind a deep pit, within which humans would build great cities and
mighty fortresses, finding refuge and shutting themselves in with the leftover inheritance of that fallen star.</p>
<p>Over the tumult and storms of the next few thousand years, the redoubts of the Dunyu Valley stood tall and maintained
prosperous relations with Liyue Harbor up till 500 years ago.</p>
<p>But with the coming of the black calamity and the rise of the Abyss, the residents of Dunyu sealed the ancient city and
departed for other lands. None know why these refugees chose to shut the gates of their home, and even the millennia-old
adepti and yaksha are silent on this matter.</p>
<p>And so, the sealed fortresses became giant, silent tombs, with naught left in them but the sound of pond water and the
wind whistling through empty halls — and thusly, too, did they come to be called the &quot;Dunyu Ruins&quot; by the people of
Liyue.</p>

<p>The stone forest of Jueyun Karst is a mysterious place engulfed in mist all year around. Myths and legends abound among
the herb gatherers, telling of adepti and evil spirits.</p>
<p>Once, there was a herb seller named Qiangu who went to Jueyun Karst to investigate the distribution of medical herbs
there. Unbeknownst to him, a group of brigands had followed him into the mountains. They waited for cover of night, and
when he let his guard down they struck. He was knocked unconscious. The brigands grabbed his possessions, bound him from
head to foot, and left him alone in the valley.</p>
<p>Deep in the night, the herb seller finally awoke. He struggled against the ropes that bound him, and cried out for help.
But the vast mountains did not respond. The only sounds to be heard in the thick mountain forest, save for the echoes of
his own pitiful wails, were the faint cries of the birds disturbed by them.</p>
<p>Qiangu sank into despair and sighed with sorrow. Just when he thought all hope was lost, a deep voice came rumbling
through the mountains, cutting through the cries of nocturnal birds and the whistling of the wind.</p>
<p>&quot;Arise!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am unable to!&quot; The herb seller protested amidst floods of tears. His cry frightened off a fox that was prowling in
the night. But as he tensed his body once more against the ropes that bound him, he discovered they had completely
loosened.</p>
<p>The herb seller stood up. No sooner had he arisen that the disembodied voice, without pausing to hear the expression of
gratitude that would be customary in such situations, spoke to him once more:</p>
<p>&quot;Ascend!&quot;</p>
<p>As instructed, Qiangu ascended the mountain, following the winding dirt track to the summit as the horizon began to glow
in the east. From the summit he saw a twisted and withered pine growing on a cliff, its branches sprawling outwards as
if trying to escape into the air. The gentle creaking of the branches drew his attention to the ropes that hung from
them — at the other end of which hung the brigands from the night before, bound in like fashion from head to foot.</p>
<p>Then he saw the old man whose voice he had heard, his hair and beard as white as snow sat atop a curiously shaped rock
as if it were his throne. The old man took one look at Qiangu's disheveled appearance and grinned mischievously before
returning his possessions to him intact.</p>
<p>Qiangu inquired as to the old man's origins, but he replied that he belonged to the mountains, his home being wherever
he roamed and his bed being wherever he laid his head. Qiangu sought to thank the old man with all manner of courtesies
and compensations, but he dismissed them all. After much deliberation, he took just a single Mora to one day give as a
wedding gift to Qiangu's beloved daughter, in order that he might attend the wedding feast.</p>
<p>Out of disaster seemed to spring forth good fortune, for following this incident Qiangu's store grew ever more popular
while word of the wealthy herb seller himself spread far and wide. Some say that after making his fortune, he returned
to Jueyun Karst in search of the old man, but found nothing save for a few abandoned tents and empty wine bottles. Some
claim to have spotted the old man at Yaoguang Shoal, disguised as a miner and darting around like the wind between the
precipices. Others insist he is a fisherman who spends his time saving those who become stranded at sea. The stories are
too many to count, and yet no one knows the old man's name.</p>
<p>Lamentably, age and ill health have now ushered in the twilight years of Qiangu's life while his beloved daughter
remains unmarried. Perhaps the day will come that the old man from the mountain attends the wedding feast, but that day
seems impossibly far in the future for Qiangu.</p>

<p>The area known as the Guili Plains was once an area lush with Glaze Lilies. But it was beset by troubles on every side,
forcing its residents of old to flee, while the prosperity of Liyue Harbor would attract many of those who took their
place. But even so, many tales of gallantry continue to circulate in these wilds.</p>
<p>In the tales of traveling merchants and porters, there was once a mysterious figure that would surface in the dead of
night upon the plains: it was a maiden in a long indigo robe, striding along the shallows of the Bishui River, the moon
wrapping her face with silver light as the night wind carried her words up to the shimmering, sleepless stars.</p>
<p>According to guests at Wangshu Inn, only those who get lost amid the firefly-lights on summer nights might see her, and
only those who can discern the scent of Glaze Lilies amid the dancing lights and Seelie floating in the dark could find
her tracks. Some guessed that she might be a lost illuminated beast, or a sole servant of some long-dead god, gently
mourning her master only at night. And some also believed her to simply be a gallant hero, like those who spurn
civilization, hiding their real names.</p>
<p>No one knows how her story began, but it ended with the tale of a certain hunter. But unlike the stories of those
merchants, the hunter encountered her brandishing a sword against several perilous shadows under the merciless
moonlight. After an elegant and sharp dance, the maiden was nowhere to be seen, with naught left but a pile of bloodied
dust. The next day, some inquisitive citizens would discover the corpses of Millelith and land surveyors by the river.
After this, no matter how many search parties the Ministry of Civil Affairs would send, no one saw that riverside maiden
ever again.</p>
<p>Perhaps that deadly dance was the fruit of some vendetta, or perhaps that woman had herself been some great brigand. Or
perhaps that matter does not require any rhyme or reason at all. Heroes are heroes, after all, drawing their blades for
reasons beyond common comprehension.</p>
<p>But as the lights of Liyue Harbor consumed the deserted countryside villages day by day, this legend too would slowly
disappear. Still, the legends hold that the riverbank that maiden had used to roam remains filled with blooming Glaze
Lilies to this day.</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-13"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-13">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>Liyue is a land where all kinds of rare and exotic treasures congregate, and where there are precious treasures, one is
sure to also find those with discerning eye.</p>
<p>The very first owner of Xigu Antiques — the unconventional collector, Min'gui — was just such an individual.</p>
<p>Xigu Antiques of Feiyun Slope was frequented by well-to-do customers. Closed during daylight hours, it only opened to
customers once the moon began to rise in the night sky. The shop's customers were anything but ordinary: they were the
wealthy and leisurely, people with outstanding taste.</p>
<p>A meticulously crafted timepiece from Fontaine, incense from Sumeru, a wine goblet once owned by an aristocrat of old
Mondstadt, a wooden stool whose surface was once graced by the buttocks of an adeptus for all of one hour, a delicate
jade teacup from which the Lord of Geo once supped a sip of tea, a priceless celadon vase that Liyue's neighbor deity,
the Anemo Archon, once accidentally knocked the to the ground, shattering it to pieces... All these and more where laid
out for the customers to peruse at their leisure, each item just waiting for that one person with whom it shared a
certain affinity.</p>
<p>One night, a wealthy young man who was walking by happen to pause in front of the shop, and began carefully examining
the items on the shelves.</p>
<p>The owner was struck by his long, black robes, dark and solemn as the looming mountain peaks, and by his eyes, which
were the color of amber.</p>
<p>This was no ordinary young man. This Min'gui could tell with one look.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to Xigu Antiques,&quot; she said. &quot;Please peruse at your leisure, and let me know if you find something you like.&quot;
Her soft voice broke the dead silence of the night. &quot;Ah...? Oh, I'm sorry.&quot; The young man smirked, and spoke in a subtly
coy manner.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just rather taken with this exquisite counterfeit.&quot;</p>
<p>The item that had caught his eye was a damaged jade plaque.</p>
<p>The face exposed to the night sky was the one on which the pattern was slightly more intact, and as the moonlight shone
down, it seeped into the intricate blemishes in the jade, exposing them, and cascaded down the ravines produced by the
crisscrossing texture on the plaque's surface. The severe wear and tear on the front and the disintegration around the
perimeter made it impossible to discern the words and images that had once been written on it. By all accounts, it
seemed to have lived a turbulent life.</p>
<p>&quot;Counterfeit, you say? What makes you so sure?&quot; Min'gui was quite used to customers making such provocative claims. But
this young man spoke so bluntly and bitingly that she could not help but feel aggravated by his accusation.</p>
<p>Added to this was the fact that this particular item had been snagged by an adventurer from an abandoned palace deep in
the heart of the abyss, who had then barely made it back out of that place alive, She recalled how she had haggled
relentlessly with the adventurer to acquire the piece, and how in the end it had still cost her the better part of her
fortune. If this truly was nothing more than a counterfeit, not only would it imply that she had lost an immense portion
of her wealth, but it would also mean irrevocable damage to the reputation of Xigu Antiques as connoisseurs of quality.</p>
<p>Min'gui knew what she had to do: Not only must she somehow get rid of this calamitous customer who threatened to ruin
her entire business, but she must also find a way to sell this jade plaque to him in the process.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, continue,&quot; she said. &quot;I would hope that you can give a detailed appraisal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As we all know, Teyvat was plunged into chaos two and a half millennia ago when the gods declared war on each other,
the ensuing conflict spreading to all people in all corners of the land. Teyvat may not have been divided into the same
seven nations we know today back in that age, but then, just as now, the people had their own settlements, cities and
civilizations...&quot; &quot;Gods whose names have now long since been forgotten were once venerated, worshiped, even adored by
their people. Our forebears took pearls and shells from the sea, jade from the mountains, rocks from the plains, and
salt crystals from the earth, each to build idols in form of their gods. &quot;Jade plaques of this kind are relics of that
era. They belonged to an ancient tribe who worshiped Rex Lapis... though, of course, the Geo Lord probably did not yet
go by the name Rex Lapis at that time.&quot; &quot;This was an age where people watched their gods clash in bitter battles before
their very eyes. Rex Lapis would not establish the currency of the seven nations and cast the first Mora coins for quite
some time. So the tribes traded using pieces of ore they would chance across from time to time, with idols made in the
likeness of the Geo Lord to ensure price stability.&quot; &quot;As you can see... Mortal wisdom is quite a fascinating thing. They
were making their own way in the world even before Rex Lapis had made provisions for them to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man paused as if to further contemplate the observation he had just made. He stood there, cloaked in a veil of
silver moonlight, which somehow served to make him every so slightly more diminutive in stature.</p>
<p>&quot;This type of jade plaque is a rare find in this day and age. Most of them are buried in riverbeds up in the mountains.
And since each one is hand carved, they are all unique... That is why they typically sell for astronomical prices. To
claim that they are priceless would not be an exaggeration.&quot; &quot;So, it is quite a shame indeed that the one you display on
your shelf is a recent counterfeit. By recent, I mean that it was probably made in your father's generation at the
earliest.&quot; &quot;There is an industry saying, 'the jade without blemish is no jade at all.' This jade, for instance, has
remarkably few imperfections, and the translucency is too good to be true... All of which points to the fact that it is
unlikely to be a product of our forebears' making.&quot; &quot;As a side point, I would also add that the image carved onto this
jade is that of a woman. This is highly unusual thing to see among similar relics from the era in question.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man held the plaque up to the moonlight to inspect it in more detail. &quot;Although there are plenty of rumors to
this effect, the claim that Rex Lapis once took the form of a woman is not attested to by any of the historical records,
and there is no physical evidence of it ever occurring...&quot;</p>
<p>Though young, the man had the air of an old and infuriating pedant about him.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, well this is where you're wrong...&quot; Min'gui smiled faintly, much as a fox does when toying with an inexperienced
hunter. &quot;Perhaps you'd be willing to listen to my story before making your final verdict?&quot;</p>
<p>The shop owner narrowed her eyes and began the process of reeling out her story...</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-12"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-12">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>Back in the age when the gods still walked upon the earth, the deity whom we now worship as Rex Lapis was but one among
many. In those days, the rumor among the common folk was that the Lord of Geo was a cold and unfeeling god. His conduct
was just in all things and his judgments were rational and dispassionate, but he lacked normal human sentiment. Like the
rocks, he was without warmth or softness. Despite this, people revered and placed their faith in him all the same. This
was because his laws served to guarantee that trade was fair and that life was safe and orderly. The Geo Archon grew in
strength and stature because of the people's belief in him.</p>
<p>But even gods are powerless to control the beliefs and doubts of their mortal followers. And even a god who is the
guardian of justice has no means of instilling the words of his rules and regulations into the heart of every
individual.</p>
<p>In Mingyun Village there was an incorrigibly irreverent jade craftsman who loved to jest. Whatever job he took on, he
would complete it in the most unorthodox means imaginable, and would always finish the job on the very last day before
it was due.</p>
<p>If the customer ordered a statue of a hunter dominating a ferocious beast, they would receive a miniature statue of a
distressed boar running for its life. And when the customer demanded an explanation, he would tell them: &quot;When a
formidable hunter closes in on a fierce beast, he may not show his face, but his imposing presence is enough to frighten
the beast to its core.&quot;</p>
<p>If the customer ordered a carving in the likeness of a powerful and mighty ruler, they would probably receive a statue
of a majestic throne. And when asked about it, he would reply: &quot;No ruler takes the throne for more than one hundred
years. The throne has longevity than he.&quot;</p>
<p>The craftsman quickly developed a reputation as an eccentric in Mingyun Village. But the wealthy merchants in the
prosperous commercial port of Liyue Harbor were most amused and were only too willing to place orders with him ー if only
to experience for themselves what it was like to be on the receiving end of this mischievous man's antics.</p>
<p>One night, a woman came to his workshop. She was dressed in a long, slender black gown and her eyes shone a brilliant
amber in the light of the crescent moon hanging in Liyue's sky that night. The craftsman had never met her before, but
he quickly found himself deep in conversation with her. It was strange, she seemed acquainted with every vein of ore and
deposit of jade in the village. She talked about the wonders of the world like they were her sisters, and spoke of jade
and precious metals with a fondness one would normally reserve for their beloved daughter... The only topics she brushed
over were culture, customs, and social interactions. Perhaps she was no wise to the ways of the world, or perhaps she
did not wish to discuss them. Regardless, there was certainly something out of the ordinary about this woman. At least,
the craftsman thought so.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like for you to make me a jade plaque bearing the likeness of the Lord of Geo on its surface.&quot; The woman
finally stated her request once their broad-reaching and lengthy conversation had reached its end, and she was all but
ready to leave. &quot;But I have one condition: You may not conjure up our Lord's likeness from your imagination. You must
carve the true likeness of our Lord relying on what you have seen with your own two eyes.&quot; &quot;Otherwise,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm
not paying a single Mora.&quot;</p>
<p>And so a deal was struck between the two, with an agreed turnaround of three days.</p>
<p>On the first day, the craftsman dined and drank with his good friends. He did not take a single new job on that day.</p>
<p>On the second day, the craftsman climbed a mountain to view the jade there, not seeing a single customer or acquaintance
for the entire day.</p>
<p>Only on the third day did the craftsman close the doors of his workshop and begin carving away at the uncut jade,
working from dawn to dusk, until finally it was complete.</p>
<p>When the crescent moon once again began to ruse in the Liyue night sky, the amber-eyed woman returned and approached his
doorstep. The craftsman proudly handed over the fruits of his labor: A jade plaque bearing the likeness of their god, in
female form.</p>
<p>The woman was puzzled. She frowned, and demanded an explanation. And this was the explanation he gave: &quot;On the first
day, I sought counsel from every wise and learned person that I know, and learned the principles of our Lord and how
they work. But this was just the skeleton.&quot; &quot;On the second day, I visited the mountains and spent a whole day observing
the mountain rocks, listening to the ebb and flow of the elements, and pondering all that our Lord had created. But this
was just the flesh.&quot; &quot;On the third day, I covered both my eyes and began to carve from the heart, starting when it felt
like the time to start, stopping when it felt like the time to stop. At last, this was the spirit.&quot;</p>
<p>The craftsman smiled awkwardly, then added: &quot;But even I'm not sure why it came out like this.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman tilted the item back and forth in her hand, as if contemplating something. &quot;Interesting,&quot; she finally
responded. &quot;Incidentally, this reminds me of another story...&quot;</p>
<p>She looked up at him with her amber-colored eyes and began the process of reeling out her story...</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-9"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-9">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Liyue is a land where all kinds of rare and exotic treasures congregate, and where there are precious treasures, one is
sure to also find those with a discerning eye. At the height of Liyue Harbor's prosperity, a myriad goods and treasures
flowed endless in and out of the land like the rising and falling tides. That age belonged, as does the current one, to
the wealthy merchants and ship owners. It was an age in which the ones who reigned supreme were those who dared wrestle
with the tumultuous tides of the market and the wrathful beasts of the ocean.</p>
<p>Likewise, then as now, the port was constantly abuzz with sailors and laborers. Legend has it that Rex Lapis, when
appearing in mortal form, does not always take the form of a distinguished gentleman fraternizing with the well-to-do of
Yujing Terrace. Sometimes, it is said, he takes the form of a commoner and mingles with the miners, the fishermen, the
sailors, and the peddlers.</p>
<p>Back in that day, there was a certain fishing vessel owner who was notoriously harsh and critical in his temperament. He
was always rude towards those who worked for him, and whenever something wasn't to his satisfaction, he would jump to
conclusions and start scolding them, even docking their wages, without giving them the opportunity to explain their side
of the story.</p>
<p>One day, the fishing vessel owner met a young man. He had just been hired by the fishing vessel owner, and his attire
was indistinguishable from that of any other seafarer of the day: a loose-fitting brown shirt and trousers, and a
bandana around his forehead. But from his tanned skin and the rugged, karst-like contours of his facial features, it was
clear that he was a commoner from Qingce Village who had come down from the mountains into the city in an attempt to
reverse his fortunes.</p>
<p>Like most mountain-dwellers of his day, he was a simple-minded and unsophisticated fellow. But what dismayed his new
boss more than this was his reluctance to go anywhere near the caches of the slimy and tentacled variety.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't make money by being choosy! Who do you think you are, lord of the manor?&quot; This was the only justification the
ship owner gave for docking the newly hired mountain's man pay.</p>
<p>The youngster simply smiled bashfully and continued with his work. This set the tone for many of the interactions
between the two. But one day, the youngster responded instead with a question: &quot;Everyone has likes and dislikes, so why
should we do the things we hate the most?&quot;</p>
<p>The fishing vessel owner was taken completely by surprise by this random question. Incensed, he slapped his simpleton
apprentice on the head and barked back at him: &quot;Them's the rules of the world, you moron! Listen good: You'll get
yourself nowhere in this world if you won't do a job you don't like!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But maybe that wasn't what Rex Lapis meant when he made the rules...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up, you idiot!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, maybe you'll understand better if I tell you a story.&quot; The young man's eyes shone like amber from the mountain
mines in the light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh? So you're a storyteller now, are you?&quot; At the thought of this simpleton from a sleepy mountain village telling him
a story, the fishing vessel owner found himself suddenly quite curious. &quot;Go on then... But I expect you to work and talk
at the same time!&quot;</p>
<p>A mischievous smile flickered across the youngster's face, and a twinkle flashed in his eye. &quot;Well then, let me tell you
a story about a certain jade plaque...&quot;</p>
<p>And so, the young man proceeded to tell his tale. His boss listened so intently that he never noticed the anonymous pair
of hands that were sneaking into his pocket — hands which subsequently pilfered the money he had made from all the wages
he had docked before distributing it back out to the laborers.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-8"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-8">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>It was a time when countless exotic curios and items would flow into Liyue Harbor. This night, Min'gui, mistress of Xigu
Antiques, was researching relics and narrating ancient stories with a unnamed son of nobility. The focal point of their
debate was a jade plaque.</p>
<p>As many knew, creating a counterfeit jade item was not a matter that cost much capital in Liyue. Creating a beautiful
fake might be a shade more expensive, but it was a cost that most merchant houses could absorb. The real trick lay in
weaving an intricate but spurious tale.</p>
<p>Like a jade smith wandering deep into the mountains, or the youth of the fisherfolk whose habits are strange, those
considered deviant often in fact strike closer to the heart of things. Rex Lapis laid down rules and contracts, but
never forced them by his authority to live by them as a perfect template, for he knew that laws and stipulations were a
means, not the end. The timeless balance lay, in truth, in a person's awareness and their ability to make choices for
themselves.</p>
<p>The harsh boss of the fishing vessel did not understand this principle, and so earned the fear and mockery of his hired
help.</p>
<p>As humans are, so too are antiques. Artistry, quality, rarity and perfection are limiting factors, yes, but the worth of
a relic lies in its backstory.</p>
<p>The picky young noble seemed not to wholly perceive this idea, and so had no qualms about calling the jade plaque a
fake, denigrating its value.</p>
<p>But if all of Xigu Antiques' treasures were to be scrutinized with such a piercing and empirical eye, their worth would
have been ground into dust.</p>
<p>Like the tears of a maiden for her captain, which became eternal pearls, or a mortal king who himself carved a portrait
of his deceased queen, before sealing his own soul into it...</p>
<p>These stories, these legends that should have faded with time were preserved, and thus teemed with life under the outer
husk of those relics.</p>
<p>&quot;A fine story, I'll take this fake, then.&quot; The noble son nodded, his golden eyes smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;After all that, you still think this is a fake?&quot; Min'gui sighed lightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; The young noble could not help but smile, and indeed had never seemed happier since entering her shop.</p>
<p>&quot;After all, the story you told about jade plaques being ancient currency — it's nonsense. Nonsense that I made up.&quot;</p>

<p>Dongdong, do you remember the beach at Yaoguang Shoal? Well I went there, and I collected lots and lots of beautiful,
golden sand. More than I can carry by myself. When I'm back, we should buy up the local mill and make fresh tofu every
single day. Although, I'd rather use all this gold to buy a house in Liyue Harbor. A huge house with a splendid sea
view. I'll let you decide how to spend it when I'm back. How does that sound?</p>
<p>Guess what? Just opposite Luhua Pool at the Guili Plains there's an enormous cliff, and what did I find there? A Ruin
Guard! He was just sitting there, slumped over, completely still. He didn't flinch even in the thunder and lightning,
not even when the rain was pelting down on him. Then I realized, he must be sleeping! So I climbed up on top of him,
threw my arms around that big old head of his, and twisted it as hard as I could. There was a clunking noise, followed
by a loud boom, and suddenly his head fell off and rolled straight off the cliff! It smashed into a million pieces at
the bottom. Shame really, otherwise I would have brought it home as a trophy, and you could have had a proper up-close
look at what a Ruin Guard's head looks like. Imagine that!</p>
<p>I also went to Jueyun Karst. I must take you there when you're older. The scenery there is incredible. The billowing
clouds look like an ocean, the waterfall is infinitely better than the one in Qingce Village, and you can sometimes
catch a glimpse of the realm of the adepti in the mountains. You can't begin to imagine how beautiful it was. And guess
what? You're not gonna believe this but... I met an actual, real-life adeptus! We sat and drank together, chatting and
laughing away... The adeptus gave me a gift too: a magic wine bottle. All you need to do is blow on it, and an infinite
supply of wine will flow from the inside! You absolutely mustn't touch it though, do you understand? You're way too
young to drink. When you're older, though, all my treasures will be yours to do with as you please.</p>
<p>My adventures in Liyue are coming to an end. It's time for me to head to the harbor, where I'll hop on the Crux and sail
off to somewhere even further away. I'm excited to see what wonderful sights and valuable treasures are waiting for me
at the next stop, and I can't wait to share them all with you! Until then Dongdong, please make sure you go to bed on
time every night. And don't eat too many sweets, they'll rot your teeth. Please also be nice to your grandma and grandpa
— seriously, don't do anything to make them mad. And no fighting! I will be home soon.</p>
<p>Lots of love, Daddy x</p>

<p><strong>Yaoguang Shoal</strong></p>
<p>The fog is setting in again... The idea of panning for gold here has turned out to be a complete waste of time. I should
have known not to trust this old mining crew, it must have been several decades since the last of them retired! Every
last bit of information they gave me is completely out of date... utterly useless. This is turning into a complete
farce. I would say I'll be going home empty-handed tonight, but the chances of me finding my way home at all in this fog
are looking slim... I hope Dongdong's eaten dinner.</p>
<p>I can hear hilichurls somewhere in the distance. I have no idea where I'm going in this fog, so I suppose I'll just
focus on walking away from the hilichurls' voices. Hopefully I'll make it out alive...</p>
<p>I don't know how long I've been walking, and in this fog I don't even know if it's daytime or nighttime. Hang on, are
those silhouettes I see up ahead? By the good grace of the Geo Lord, maybe I can join along with them and find a way out
of here. Yep, that's what I'm gonna do. Hooray, I'm saved!</p>
<p>On closer inspection, the silhouettes didn't look like friendly characters. I've decided to set up a camp here and wait
for them to leave before figuring out my next move. I might have to go back the way I came.</p>
<p>Egads! I can hear hilichurls all around me... I should definitely—</p>
<p>-End of diary content-</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-10"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-10">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p><strong>Guili Plains</strong></p>
<p>What a string of bad luck...</p>
<p>I finally made it out of that hilichurl camp alive, only to end up nearly being killed by a Ruin Guard! I'd figured it
was probably out of action given the way it was sat there completely motionless in the torrential rain. But then a bolt
of lightning struck it right on the head... There was some whirring and grinding, and suddenly it was back to life.</p>
<p>I was powerless to defend myself against it. It lifted me up like a baby bird and tossed me from the top of the cliff.
Luckily, amidst my frantic scrambling, I managed to duck into a cave at the foot of the cliff. It was out of his line of
sight, so it gave up trying to find me. If not for that cave, it'd have ripped me to shreds, thrown me to the ground,
and then stomped me into... I don't even know what you'd call it by that point!</p>
<p>Surely it must be well away from here by now... Even so, I can still hear the droning noise it made, like a swarm of
bees buzzing around inside my head. I think I must have broken my arm, because it hurts when I put any pressure on it. I
think – I hope – that I will be able to manage, though. In any case, at my age I need to grin and bear it. I mean, what
would Dongdong and his mother think of me if I didn't?</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-9"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-9">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p><strong>Jueyun Karst</strong></p>
<p>Near the foot of the cliff, I ran into a herb gatherer who helped me set the bone. I almost passed out from the pain.
But he did say that most passers-by he meets who have survived an encounter with a Ruin Guard tend to be less physically
intact than I am... Every cloud has a silver lining, I guess.</p>
<p>From above, Jueyun Karst looks completely untouched by human activity. It's also shrouded in mist, and to add to the
mystery it's impossible to know just how deep the mist goes. Strange noises can be heard coming from the stone forest.
Whether it's illuminated beasts or celestial beings in there, I don't know. All I know is it made the hairs on the back
of my neck stand up. With any luck I should be able to pick up a quality chunk of amber here, or maybe some highly
prized medicinal herbs. I know that back in the day many of poorer village folks made their fortunes and built their
lives in Liyue by selling herbal medicine, and I see no reason why I couldn't do the same.</p>
<p>It rained heavily in the evening, which meant the cliff face was too slippery to climb up. I also couldn't find my
climbing rope or axe anywhere. It's strange, I'm not the type to lose things so easily... I'll bet one of the monsters
lurking in the mountains pinched it when I wasn't looking! Maybe it was a fox...</p>
<p>After several days of fruitless searching, I finally found some good medicinal herbs so I'm getting ready to head back.
I had wanted to do one final search, but this place is starting to creep me out. As soon as night falls I keep thinking
I see shadowy figures following me everywhere... Also, the blood-curdling cries of some unknown species of monster are
now coming from all directions — and they're getting closer...</p>
<p>During my descent down the mountain, I came across an old wine bottle. I gave it a rinse with some spring water, and
found it's in good condition. I bet Dongdong would like it if I gave it to him as a souvenir. I'll just tell him that it
was a treasure given to me by an adeptus.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-3"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-3">Volume 5</a></h2>
<p><strong>Liyue Harbor</strong></p>
<p>I sold the herbs at Bubu Pharmacy. Made back everything I've lost, plus a little extra. At this rate, I could buy a
house in Liyue within the next few years. Just in time for Dongdong to settle in before he starts school.</p>
<p>If I'd studied harder when I was younger, I wouldn't have ended up getting involved with those scumbag Treasure Thieves.
I also wouldn't have squandered the inheritance my father left me. This makes me think that I must get Dongdong a good
teacher who makes him study hard. That's the only way he'll make reliable friends and not end up like his wretched old
man. So, for Dongdong's sake, I can't give up now. I have got to find a way to make a good living.</p>
<p>...That said, I couldn't get the idea of making a quick fortune out of my head. So I tried my luck at The Jade Mystery.
I hadn't intended to spend any money at a place like that, but the boss, Shitou, was very persuasive... He talked me
into putting all my money into it. I didn't do too badly. I cut open the stone I bought and found it to be
higher-quality jade. Then again, that one brief foray into the world of gambling on stones meant that I had to pawn the
sickle and the medicine box I'd used for foraging for herbs.</p>
<p>I'm penniless now. Sure, I got some good jade pieces from gambling on stones, but jade isn't easy to shift. So it looks
like I'm back in survival mode again. I think I'll head overseas and see how it goes. I should try joining the Crux
Fleet, here's hoping Captain Beidou will take me on.</p>
<p>I'll happily scrub the deck if it comes to it, I haven't eaten in three days.</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-3"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-3">Volume 6</a></h2>
<p><strong>Jinren Island</strong></p>
<p>After stealing a small boat from the pirate ship, I rowed for three days before finally reaching shore.</p>
<p>From here, I can see the legendary Takayama on Narukami Island, along with the giant sakura tree that grows on it. The
colors of the Sacred Sakura are gentle in the moonlight... It makes me think of home.</p>
<p>I wonder if Dongdong feels lonely in Qingce Village. I don't know if I made the right decision, coming all this way just
to make a living. It's probably me just getting old, thinking about all this nonsense.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon a purple melon while exploring this remote island. It tasted astringent, and rather lacked taste; my
teeth and tongue turned purple from eating the skin and it took a while for the color to fade... Next time I'll try
cooking it before eating. I've set up camp. At first light, I'll walk south... I heard the pirates say that that's where
Inazuma is.</p>
<p>There should be plenty of job opportunities in the city. Maybe I should give up the foolish idea of adventuring and find
a real job. When I've saved up enough money and bought my own house, I'll send for Dongdong to come live with me.</p>
<p>Besides, the housing here is much cheaper than in Liyue Harbor.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Rex Lapis descended. He lowered the tides, raised Mt. Tianheng, and calmed the waves. Thereupon, peace
was brought to the people. They cut into the mountain and found jade, they bored through the rock and made tunnels, and
they piled up stones and built a settlement. It is written that the jade from the bowels of the mountain is that which
glows. Hence, they named it &quot;Shanhui Fort&quot;[1]. In that time, all the people of Tianheng derived their livelihood from
the mines, all prospered from them, and none knew poverty within a thousand-mile radius.</p>
<p>[1] Better known today as &quot;Shanhui Rock,&quot; which is often simplified to &quot;Mountain Rock,&quot; thereby stripping the name of
most of its original meaning.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Guizhong, the Lord of Dust, was an ally to the Lord of Rock. Around Mt. Tianheng, Guizhong set up a Crossbow to keep
guard, and it was named the &quot;Guizhong Ballista.&quot; She brought her people to the north of Mt. Tianheng and taught them to
tend the soil. Agriculture became their livelihood, and all prospered from it. The farming towns stretched for miles,
and it was said that one could walk all the way to Stone Gate without ever leaving the network of pathways between the
fields. Guizhong said to the Lord of Rock: &quot;My people had left their home and came to this place. Here, they are happy
in their abodes and content in their work, thus it is as if they have returned home. Hence, what better name to call
this place than 'the Plains of the Returning and Departing?'&quot; The Lord of Rock praised the Lord of Dust for her work,
and thereafter the area was named in the tongue of Liyue &quot;Guili Plains.&quot;</p>
<p>[2] It later came to pass that the gods each strove for dominance, which brought catastrophe upon the land. Though the
adepti fought to protect the Guili Plains, they could not stop the tide of war, which ravaged the plains and took the
life of its ruler, Guizhong. Thereupon, the Lord of Rock Rex Lapis took his people south of Mt. Tianheng. Thus the
people departed from the Guili Plains for good, never to return, and it was left to become a wilderness.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Rex Lapis pacified the gods, adepti and yakshas were content in their positions, and Liyue re-entered an era of peace.
Before this time, the gods waged war for centuries on end, and not one field was left unravaged. The people of Liyue
turned to commerce and artisanship for their livelihood, and prospered once more. Those who prospered above the rest
joined, calling themselves the Qixing. Thus was formed the framework around which Liyue Harbor developed. Under the
jurisdiction of the Qixing were all the known trades, no business of Liyue took place inside or outside the nation that
was not known unto them. The Millelith also took orders from the Qixing, supporting the masses at home and suppressing
the monsters at the border. Thus became the nature of Liyue's governance under Rex Lapis.</p>

(Aloud)<br />
Zixin: &quot;The tide reflects the mountains low, a light breeze nurtures reefs below.&quot;<br />
(Aside)<br />
Zixin: &quot;I am a fisherman's daughter, I grew up by the dock. This year I am sixteen years old.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;My parents are old now. What choice do I have but to take up the oar myself? It would seem I am fated for a
life on the ocean.&quot;<br />
(Dongtang, lento, innig)<br />
Zixin: &quot;With sail rope in hand, I cast a net among the free-swimming fish. It is with their trade that I shall sustain
my family.&quot;<br />
(Zixin casts out the net and brings it back in)<br />
(Dongtang, appassionato)<br />
Zixin: &quot;It is hard every day under the sun, moon, and stars. The rich live fitfully whilst the poor must struggle. This
is the way of things.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;I too am envious of the wealthy women's splendor, though I have never pitied myself, even with but a single
string of pearls on my wrist.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;I have nothing to show for myself but bare walls. All I have is what I make with my own hands.&quot;<br />
(Zixin ties her boat to the wharf and jumps to the shore)<br />
(Dongtang, senza misura)<br />
Zixin: &quot;It's time to go on the streets and sell fish.&quot;<br />
(Exit Zixin)</p>

<p>(Enter Zixin carrying a hand-basket)<br />
(Dongtang, straziante)<br />
Zixin: &quot;Fresh fish, fresh fish! Buy it here, buy it now!&quot;<br />
(Enter Grandma Zhang carrying a flower basket)<br />
(Sprechstimme)<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;Look at those fish (fish wag their tails, spraying Grandma Zhang with water), so fierce! They will make
a tasty soup!&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;All soaked like that, from head to hips, don't I look like a young lady with pink cheeks and vermilion
lips?&quot;<br />
(Aside)<br />
Zixin: &quot;What do they call you, granny?&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;You can call me Grandma Zhang. I sell flowers on this street.&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;Deary, such a soft-spoken girl like you won't sell a fish before the sky turns dark.&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;You might be beautiful, but if you're too shy to raise your voice, you won't be able to fill your
stomach.&quot;<br />
(Zixin lowers her head)<br />
(Aside)<br />
Zixin: &quot;You're so funny, granny.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;Oh no... Where...&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;My string of pearls, I never take it off my wrist. But it's gone. How could that be?&quot;<br />
(Enter Fan Jie, dressed in colorful stage clothing and holding the string of pearls)<br />
(Dongtang, andante calmo)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Like a golden crow that utters the truth beyond the waves blue, I went for a stroll and a string of pearls
appeared in my view.&quot;<br />
(Aside)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;My name's Fan Jie, at your service. I make a living doing odd jobs in the docks. My brothers here selected
me as their leader.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;The string of pearls I picked up today must belong to that lady.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;I intend to return it to its rightful owner, though I don't want to be falsely accused of any indecent act.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Perhaps I shall see if there are any marks of wearing the pearls on her wrist.&quot;<br />
(Dongtang, 12-bar prelude, irato)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;In scorching sun and steaming breeze, does selling fish come with ease?&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;My fish are fresh, that I guarantee. Boil them or fry, the choice belongs to thee.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Those fish are as fierce as a tiger, they won't stop moving even for a second.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Would you step forward and introduce yourself?&quot;<br />
(Zixin steps forward)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;It's only fitting that these beautiful pearls belong to a fair lady of equal beauty.&quot;<br />
(Dongtang, appassionato)<br />
Zixin: &quot;My heart is telling me that this man might be a mack, taking pleasure in playing with me, but he won't fool me
with his nonsense.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;I turn around with my apricot eyes wide open and scold him.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;Such a scoundrel like you must have no dignity!&quot;<br />
(Aside)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;No need to get so angry, milady. I just wanted to check if there are marks of wearing the pearls on your
wrist.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;It looks like, indeed, you are the rightful owner, milady. Now that the string of pearls is returned to you,
you need not worry anymore.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;My name's Fan...&quot;<br />
(Fan Jie pauses, covers his mouth, and turns to leave. Exit Fan Jie.)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;It's time for me to go, ha.&quot;<br />
(Aside)<br />
Zixin: &quot;Oh hero, please wait...&quot;<br />
(Dongtang, lento, innig)<br />
Zixin: &quot;Led by my timid heart, I wronged a righteous man.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;I can't even remember the name of that hero of mine. What should I do to thank him?&quot;<br />

Zixin: &quot;How shameful...&quot;<br />

<p>(Enter Zixin and Grandma Zhang)<br />
(Aside)<br />
Zixin: &quot;I have been depressed of late, and in no wise have I been at peace.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;For I spoke in error 'gainst a hero seeking to do good.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;He sought to return my string of pearls, and I did him no thanks nor ask him his name, but instead upbraided
him most grievously.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;Shamed I am, and do wish to find my benefactor, but amidst this vast harbor, how shall I find him?&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;As I see it, deary, you need not be sorrowful, nor should you be troubled.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;Oh, granny, why do you say so?&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;You need only put up a notice, offering Mora up to the one who returns the string of pearls. Will he
not then come forth?&quot;<br />
(Ganging, andante calmo)<br />
Zixin: &quot;Thus is it said—&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;As wine turns red peoples' faces, so do riches move many places.&quot;<br />

Zhang San: &quot;Hark at that notice! Let me go up, and earn the bounty.&quot;<br />
Li Si: &quot;Shall the officer ask, 'think to do good, do you?'&quot;<br />
Wang Er'ma: &quot;Hah! A fool is he who would speak true.&quot;<br />
(Aside)<br />
Zhang San: &quot;Ho, brothers. Are you all bound for that lass Zixin's place, her reward to claim?&quot;<br />
Li Si: &quot;Indeed.&quot;<br />
Wang Er'ma: &quot;So it is.&quot;<br />
Li Si: &quot;Picked up her headdress also, did you?&quot;<br />
Wang Er'ma: &quot;No, I'd have sworn it was her earrings.&quot;<br />
Li Si: &quot;Falsehood - t'was the flower upon her head.&quot;<br />
Zhang San: &quot;Fools. Perfume it was!&quot;<br />
Wang Er'ma: &quot;Ah, however it may be, sure am I that we all know well the score.&quot;<br />
Zhang San: &quot;Ahahah.&quot;<br />
Li Si: &quot;Haha!&quot;<br />

Wang Er'ma: &quot;No, no, no, Wang Er'ma it is who returns your earrings. Mine is the reward.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;You... you lot dizzy me.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;For we have never met, and if I lost my earrings, scents, or headwear, would I not know it?&quot;<br />
Zhang San: &quot;Why, you must have forgotten it in your hurry at the fish-store. Just give the reward here, do not worry!&quot;<br />
Li Si: &quot;The Mora, then, and be quick about it!&quot;<br />
Wang Er'ma: &quot;Or I shall ruin your stall, and your good name.&quot;<br />

Grandma Zhang: &quot;Or else...&quot;<br />
Zhang San: &quot;Or else what?&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;Then the headdress made of prize Glaze Lilies, the earrings of fine Noctilucous Jade, and the scents
shipped in from a faraway land...<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;You shall have to pay for them all! Now then, where is the Mora? Give it here!&quot;<br />

<p><strong>Scene III</strong></p>
<p>(Zhang San brings Fan Jie in)<br />
(Aside)<br />
Zhang San: &quot;Why, I have it now. You must be the thief who took the lady's things. My brothers and I took a beating on
your account!&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;I, Fan Jie, have ever been upright, and such things as stealing are beneath me. Do not think to accuse me
falsely.&quot;<br />
Zhang San: &quot;Well, aren't you a stubborn one? Dare you go up with me to meet the owner of the lost goods?&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;I fear you not. Let us go! Indeed, I should like to see who it is who maligns me.&quot;<br />
(Zhang San and Fan Jie turn to Zixin)<br />
Zhang San: &quot;Is the proprietor not Zixin? I shall see how you get out of this one!&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Ah! So it is you, then!&quot;<br />
(Dongtang, appassionato)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;This was the lady who was wroth, and no more words came from her mouth.&quot;<br />
(Dongtang, allegro)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Cease deceiving the young woman, for I am Fan Jie, a dock worker.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;I have lived frugally and humbly. Whereupon would I steal a lady's makeup?&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;You met my honesty with accusations, though I returned the item swiftly as I could.&quot;<br />
(Aside)<br />
Zixin: &quot;Ah, so this hero is named Fan Jie.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;It is my fault, then, that he should have been tangled up in this business.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;I shall beg his forgiveness shortly — and should he not accept, twice or thrice more shall not be too few.&quot;<br />
(Zixin walks up to apologize to Fan Jie)<br />
Zixin: &quot;O, hero, indeed we had a misunderstanding before, but...&quot;<br />
(Fan Jie turns)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Hmph.&quot;<br />
(Zixin smiles and steps forward)<br />
Zixin: &quot;...I did have some other motive in doing this.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;For you did not leave your name behind when you left, and I wished to repay you but found you not.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;So I decided on this device. It is my fault that such trouble came to you.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;Please, allow me to apologize.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
(Dongtang, lento, innig)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Though I was at first resentful to be maligned, when I calm down to think, I realize it was but a
misunderstanding.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Calm must rule me, lest I speak in error.&quot;<br />
(Aside)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;If I may ask you...&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;You said earlier that the business from before was a misunderstanding.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;You were of a mind to seek the person who returned your string of pearls, and put out that notice, which by
chance snared me wrongly, is that true?&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;It is, and again, I apologize.&quot;<br />
(Fan Jie catches Zixin)<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Nay, you need not be so polite. You do me too much honor.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;I, too, acted rashly, and put you upon the spot. I, too, must apologize.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;Oh, no, please...&quot;<br />
(Fan Jie salutes her)<br />
Zhang San: &quot;What!? What are you doing? So is the Mora to be paid or not?&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;Oh, shush you. This is their tale — what business is it of yours?&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;See, all the ladies and gentlemen in the audience are here to see a show by Yun Jin. and they have no
time for your nonsense.&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;Open your eyes and see, and stand aside there.&quot;<br />
(Exeunt, Grandma Zhang dragging Zhang San)<br />
Zixin: &quot;Come to think of it, I sell fish here every day. How is it, then, that I have never seen you?&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;I pass this way each day to work.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;Perhaps I was lost amid the throng. But perchance we may meet tomorrow...&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;So it is... May we meet then.&quot;</p>

(Aside)<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;Wu Yi, Wu Er!&quot;<br />
(Same aside)<br />
Both: &quot;Yes, sir?&quot;<br />
(Aside)<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;I have a mind to eat something new today. Have you any ideas?&quot;<br />
Wu Yi: &quot;What about some Golden Shrimp Balls?&quot;<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;I tire of fine meat and fatty fish. Golden Shrimp Balls seem alright.&quot;<br />
Wu Wang: Wu Er, go hence and find a s tore that sells a serving of those shrimp balls.&quot;<br />
Wu Er: &quot;I will.&quot;<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;Wait. It must be fried to a pure golden sheen, with not a speck of char-black to be found.&quot;<br />
Wu Er: &quot;Without a speck of char-black to be found, yes.&quot;<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;Hold. And they must be of size most equal. Not one shall be larger or smaller than the next.<br />
Wu Er: &quot;And they shall all be the same size, yes. Do you wish to go over the instructions again?&quot;<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;No need.&quot;<br />
Wu Er: &quot;Do you have any other requests, sir? Just say the word.&quot;<br />
Wu Er: &quot;And if the store fails to meet your expectations, then let's do as we always do—&quot;<br />
Wu Yi: &quot;What do we always do?&quot;<br />
Wu Er: &quot;Not give them any Mora, of course.&quot;<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;No, no, come, look at the fish store yonder. Now there's a beauty more filling than a fine meal.&quot;<br />

Zixin: &quot;Would you like to buy fish, sir?&quot;<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;Why, of course of course. Which family do you hail from, miss, and where fare your parents?&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;I grew up at the docks. My parents have grown old, and I run the store alone, selling fish to make ends meet.&quot;<br />
Zixin: &quot;Why do you ask, sir?&quot;<br />
(Turns, sotto voce)<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;Better still, excellent! She has plighted no troth. If trouble should come of this, no one will save her.&quot;<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;Then miss, have you one you are enamored with?&quot;<br />
(Zixin lowers her head and says nothing)<br />
(Dongtang, senza misura)<br />
Wu Wang: &quot;See, see how she casts down her eyes without speaking. So, then, there is no such person. Evil enters and
masters my thoughts—&quot;<br />

Grandma Zhang: &quot;Shall we not now accelerate towards a fight most fierce?&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;&quot;But afore the hero steps forth, he must by fortune be inspired.&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;When evil beasts run amok, disturbing the lives of the people, or when times and tides are turbulent,
that is when heroes arise.&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;If you should pluck up your courage, your deeds shall be remembered. But if you prove craven...&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang: &quot;Who then will remember if you were named Zhang Jie, Wang Jie, or Fan Jie?&quot;<br />
Grandma Zhang &quot;And what's more, we ordinary folk must show our mettle, and yet leave a tale of rescuing our fair

Fan Jie: &quot;Ah, alas!&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;When I heard her words I was a-fright, but I never thought that catastrophe was so near to me.&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;This villain burns, steals, and kills as he wills. If I were to go forth...&quot;<br />
Fan Jie: &quot;I shall in all likelihood, not return.&quot;<br />

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tales-from-the-waves"><a class="header" href="#tales-from-the-waves">Tales From the Waves</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-rising-tide"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-rising-tide">Volume 1: Rising Tide</a></h2>
<p>As the moon hung bright among the sea of stars above, hums of a sea shanty slowly began to rise over the waters below.</p>
<p>There once was a mighty ship that would lay anchor in Liyue Harbor. Its captain was a man who tracked and hunted
terrible monsters of the deep, known as the &quot;Skipper&quot;. The ships hull was adorned with skeletons of monsters from the
sea, an unmistakable signal of their Skipper's fearless will. However, the shanties of the crew seldom made any mention
of hunting creatures of the deep. It's not that the sailors didn't revel in their reputation and brag of their
achievements, but ages of navigating the merciless seas had taught them that ballads of blood and water were the most
unlucky of all.</p>
<p>With his sword in hand, the Skipper sailed across the watery expanse, coasting along rocky reefs and cruising with
surging undercurrents. He fearlessly guided his ship to face the roar of squalls and sea monsters alike. The dark worlds
that laid beneath murky waters were like boundless hunting grounds. Any monster that would dare stir the tranquil waters
often became the next trophy hanging from the side of the ship.</p>
<p>But the Skipper only knew wind and waves, and never seemed to grasp the bittersweet lives of ordinary people. For he
occupied all his days with searching and hunting, accompanied solely by the salty sea breeze and the muffled calls of
whales in the deep. The crew feared him more than they adored him, ever cautious of his character, relentless as if
trying to break free from tangles of seaweed. The Skipper's clipper silently sailed forward, unyielding to the perilous
stretches of sea.</p>
<p>Only the young maiden who always sat atop the towering bow could ever reveal a glimmer of softness to the Skipper's
eyes. She was his navigator, charmed by the tidal song and humming with the whales, guiding the ship through the wind
and waves to waters infested by beasts.</p>
<p>A young maiden at the helm offered her songs to the sea, paying due respect to its every billow and breeze...</p>
<p>&quot;Hark the calls of creatures deep, and echoes of waves tossed in the gale.<br />
When the sea and winds flow in our favor, towards the horizon shall we sail.&quot;<br />
&quot;May the deities that have passed, and me ol' captain too,<br />
Steer our bow through the boundless sea, and point our compass true.<br />
May we guide every sailor's soul, to the port they call home.&quot;</p>
<p>The chorus of the shanty gave way to the bellowing orders of the Skipper, promptly calling all hands to set sail. The
mighty vessel slowly left the port and came underway, sinking into the horizon under the first glimmer of dawn.</p>
<p>This is how the story of every voyage would begin, just as they had each day before.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-wild-storm"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-wild-storm">Volume 2: Wild Storm</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Come with me into the watery abyss, listening to murmurs of the deep.<br />
When the wind and waves are right, we sail towards maelstroms of the sea.<br />
I hear the jabber of me ol' lady, wishing well to her heirs to come:<br />
May they navigate blasting winds and o'er dancing waves,<br />
Pierced by heroes' harpoons, may the monster's lair meet the last of its days.&quot;</p>
<p>Even in the most violent of squalls, her constant shanties never ceased. The voice of the maiden harmonized with the
raging waves, guiding the Skipper over deathly currents, sailing boldly towards the eye of the storm where the sea
monster lay lurking.</p>
<p>Skimming across the vortex, ushered by lightning and waterspouts, the ship inched further into the monster's treacherous
waters. Flashes of lightning revealed the Skipper's silhouette, fearlessly grasping his sword.</p>
<p>Following the Skipper's fixed gaze, the crew could only make out an alpine shape shadowed by tenebrous clouds. The
massive figure that lay skulking in the distance was the body of the beast. The once fearsome skeletons that hung from
the ship now seemed like mere cubs compared with the terrifying silhouette that lay sprawling before them like a
mountain range in the center of the maelstrom.</p>
<p>At the Skipper's bellowing command, the crew fired broadside after broadside of giant crossbows, unleashing their mortal
fears and delusions on the massive body that lay like a towering wall before them. The barrages of cannonballs and
barbed iron harpoons left gruesome wounds on the body of the beast.</p>
<p>The sea monster hissed violently in pain, plunging beneath the huge crimson waves before slamming the ship's hull with
all its might. The ship nearly capsized against the might of the blow, and crimson waves came crashing across the decks.
The sailors were drenched in the foul torrents as they cursed the gods of the elements and continued to rake the body of
the beast with stones and sharpened spears.</p>
<p>The ruthless Skipper never flinched at the opponents dealt to him by fate. The thundering roars of the terrible beast
were answered by songs of the young maiden atop the bow. The ship maneuvered round the monster, cruising upon the
spinning torrents, and answering sharp fangs and swiping stingers with catapults, harpoons, slings, and even mortal
bodies to vent their dread and fury.</p>
<p>Once the monster's body was riddled with wounds and nearly all its tentacles and claws had been severed, the Skipper's
ship too had been reduced to a floating hulk. Half of the ship's masts had fallen, half of its guns were out of action,
and half the crew had been taken as dinner for the monster – even the Skipper's prized sword had been cleaved in two.
This was an unwinnable bout, much like a mere child challenging a full-grown adult.</p>
<p>The injured monster knew very well that its opponent no longer posed any threat. Craving to devour the ship that
now lay dead in the water, it rose to the surface and exposed its gaping mouth.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-receding-torrent"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-receding-torrent">Volume 3: Receding Torrent</a></h2>
<p>Although the moon was veiled by dark clouds, her shanty did not cease.</p>
<p>As the surface grew eerily calm amidst the storm, the splintered ship drifted slowly towards the abyss. The monster's
massive spiraling mouth lay open wide, and a rumbling growl came from deep within it. The monster was content with its
prey and opened its eyelids, crusted in reef and coral, to witness the final moments of yet another opponent who had
underestimated it. The monster's massive eyes revealed their fragile gaze to the dying Skipper.</p>
<p>The monster revealed in the moment and through his pair of eyes beheld a heart that was darker than the abyss. A final
bolt of lightning flashed in the sky above, illuminating the ship as it split into two among the monster's swirling
fangs, fading beneath a mist of splinters. Even the screams from the keel were drowned beneath the waves.</p>
<p>And then it was dark again... until the furious roar of the monster broke out over the black waters once more.</p>
<p>The Skipper plunged his severed sword into the eye of the beast again and again, until he was immersed beneath the
filthy tide, when finally his broken sword became lodged in the monster's soft eyeball. As the Skipper drew closer to
his treacherous fate, clutched by countless claws and pincers, he continued fighting tooth and nail until the monster's
sharp claws were torn into pieces...</p>
<p>A familiar tune then filled the salty breeze as the monster's movements began to cease.</p>
<p>&quot;Sing with me, farewell to the sea, a shanty I hold so dear,<br />
When the sea and winds flow in our favour, I know my end is near.<br />
Ol' captain is calling me name, back to whence I came,<br />
So forget not the captain and I, and hum this melody again.<br />
There will come a day when at last you find me, slumbering in the abyssal deep...<br />
Or perhaps you too then, will be swallowed by the whirlpool in the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>The monster's gigantic tentacles burst forth from the water, snaking upwards like towering columns, but the young maiden
simply lay there floating on her back, singing amidst the turmoil. Even as the tentacles coiled tightly around her arms,
even as the sharp claws pierced her skin, and even as they shredded her clothing to pieces, leaving it floating in
tatters on the sea, still she continued to sing her farewell shanty towards the Skipper.</p>
<p>Then, the maiden was gently pulled into the black sea by the monster.</p>
<p>In an age where the sea was ruled by unpredictable disasters the people of the waves die each passing day. The Skipper
awoke to find himself on the deck of some unknown merchant ship. Having lost his ship and entire crew, all he had left
was a body covered in wounds and an old dream echoing an ethereal sea shanty.</p>
<p>&quot;When the sea and winds are right, I will go forth to sea and avenge her, O maiden charmed by the tidal song...&quot;</p>

<p>Of all the elements in the land, Geo alone stands fast,<br />
Built on a bedrock of proud tradition, which doth make it last.<br />
For just is the law of Rex Lapis, and ineffable His wisdom —<br />
The cornerstones of justice, which prevails throughout His kingdom.<br />
Slayer of foul demons, no evil would He leave unquenched.</p>
<p>He sought celestial order, to stay the tide of turbulence.<br />
Adepti rallied round Him, yaksha guardians charged ahead,<br />
Frightened by the courageous people the demons fled.<br />
The Lord then fashioned mighty rocks, which into the earth He cast:<br />
The sea monster subdued, peace returned at last!</p>
<p>Though demons lay defeated, their souls did plot revenge.<br />
Down into the watery abyss the demonic souls did descend.<br />
Hatred fueled their rage. Rage, in turn, did blunt their mind,<br />
Their folly sullied the seas, whence the demons multiplied:<br />
A demonic infestation thus engendered by the fallen souls.</p>
<p>Five yaksha guardians His Majesty task'd with evil to defeat,<br />
To rid the world of poisonous rage with which the demons seethed.<br />
Mountains shook as yaksha wrath with golden splendor burned,<br />
But though they purged the evil, alas! One alone returned:<br />
Alatus, by whose talons foes were quashed and peace procured.</p>
<p>A peace that harked to days gone by was the peace that now endured.<br />
Peace restored, adepti back to Jueyun Karst ascended.<br />
Duty fulfilled, yakshas off to unknown corners departed.<br />
May this lowly offering departed souls appease.<br />
And may these words by fire's light His Majesty's heart please.</p>

<p>Liyue knew naught but plague in antiquity. The warmongering gods made it so, for the vanquished were crushed under the
rocks, and there they rotted and became soil. Thus were they returned to the cycle of Elements, which doth span both
Heaven and Earth, and which knows no end. But some souls held on to their hatred and took on flesh once more as daemons.
The daemons rose up in anger, giving rise to a miasma, which in turn engendered all manner of plagues, monsters and
other perverse evils. They starved the earth and churned the waters, and wrought devastation on the people. Therefore,
it is said: The daemonic is the shadow of the divine.</p>
<p>&quot;Liyue suffered many outbreaks of disease in ancient times. Some say this was caused by the chaos of the relentless
warring between gods. The defeated were squashed beneath the rocks of the earth, where they decomposed and became soil,
and finally re-entered the everlasting elemental cycle. Some of the gods' souls were filled with bitterness at their
fate, and refused to suffer it any longer. Their bitterness materialized and became evil monsters. The monsters' rage
manifested itself in the form of diseases, monster infestations, and all kinds of other strange occurrences. The
monsters ravaged the land and turned it into a wilderness, and unleashed all manner of evil upon the rivers and seas.
They inflicted untold suffering on the people. Hence, what we call monsters are in fact physical manifestations of the
resentment of gods defeated in war.&quot;</p>
<p>Rex Lapis summoned Yakshas unto him to purge the daemons. Illuminated beasts of dreadful appearance and warlike
temperament were they, and no brutality did they spare in their duty to defend. Of the many, five were the strongest:
Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus. Wherever battle took Rex Lapis, so did they follow, until the plague
was purged. The five are known unto mortals as &quot;The Yakshas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rex Lapis summoned yakshas to help him destroy the monsters. The yakshas were illuminated beasts of Liyue. Ferocious
and intimidating to behold, they were violent by nature and formidable in battle, ready to kill mercilessly to defend
Rex Lapis' rule. Among the yakshas, five were known as the strongest: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus.
The five followed Rex Lapis into battle countless times, finally wiping out the evil at its source. They became know
throughout the world simply as 'The Yakshas'.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Yakshas&quot; were guardians of Rex Lapis for years without measure, and the evils they vanquished were incalculable.
Yet, mighty though they were, beyond the torment that betide all who face war the Yakshas were not, and they became
afflicted. Some were given unto their rage, others unto a madness which fear mongered. Many turned to the slaughter of
their own, others were bewitched by shadows of the soul. After a millennium did fate present itself unto them, and it
was such: three of the five perished, the fourth vanished, and all of the myriad shared the fate of the three or the
fourth. The fifth alone prevailed, and the fifth was Alatus.</p>
<p>&quot;The Yakshas' faithfully protected Rex Lapis and pacified all manner of catastrophes in the world. This continued for
many years. But there came a day when the yakshas, despite their might, found that their deeds had taken their toll, and
that the remnants of divine bitterness had begun to poison them. Some descended into a blind rage of a kind that can not
be put into words, or were driven by fear to equally indescribable madness. Some turned on and destroyed each other.
Some were lost to delusions of the mind. After a thousand years' scourges, three of the five were slain, and one
disappeared. Many other yaksha of unknown name also either died or fled. In the end, only one of the five, Alatus,
survived.&quot;</p>
<p>Alatus is the Golden-Winged King who is also the Conqueror of Demons. None knows whence he came, nor whither he went.
Only at springtime, during the offering of lanterns at night, might the people see the glow at Guyun and declare:
&quot;Behold, the Vigilant Yaksha ends the dominion of daemons!&quot; Or they might hear the sound of a flute amongst the marsh
reeds, but find none who play the flute, and thus declare: &quot;Hark, the yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their
homeland.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alatus is also known as the Golden-Winged King, or alternatively as the Conqueror of Demons. Nobody knows where he came
from, and nobody knows where he went. In spring of each year, when the Lantern Rite festival arrives, Liyue people will
glaze at the glow in the air above Guyun Stone Forest, and say: 'Behold, the Guardian Yaksha ends the dominion of
demons.' Some hear a sound like a flute coming from Dihua Marsh, but when they enter the marsh there is no flutist to be
found. They say: 'Hark, the Yaksha calls to summon his old friends to their homeland.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus, divine endowment doth carry with it that ultimate and unbreakable trial: to lose kin, friend, or ally, to face the
impossibility of redemption, to burn in everlasting anger and know no respite. To become the foe of an ancient evil was
to abandon hope of both reward and resolution in his endeavors, and his torment was that of the preta, which is to be
without satiety after ten thousand fates.</p>
<p>&quot;For this reason, it is said that the wages of being blessed with supernatural power is a destiny of hardship and
eventual destruction. For the Yaksha lost all his friends, family, and those he fought alongside. He built up an
incalculable karmic debt from the violent deeds his like necessitated, and the consequence was a heart filled with
darkness and hatred from which there was no rest. There was no reward to be gained from making an enemy of his own
bitterness and hatred from the old days, nor there any escape from the unbearable suffering. The torment ate away at his
heart like an insatiable wolf, and an infinite number of lifetimes could have done nothing to reduce it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if Emperor Sher's ambitions are realized, how will anybody benefit from it?&quot;</p>
<p>Secretary of Defense Faranges stared out of the window into space as the galaxies and stars shone gently upon her face,
their pale white glow flowing softly and slowly down each strand of her hair.</p>
<p>She couldn't help but think back to the first time she looked out at this ocean of stars through this very window. But
she no longer remembered the sense of awe she felt back then. Even her homeland, now hundreds of light-years away, had
long since become faded and distorted in her memories whenever they surfaced in her dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;Forgive me for speaking out of place, Your Highness, but this war has been dragging on for far too long. We've battled
through countless constellations, wiped out tens of millions of lives in all sorts of devious ways, and made ourselves
viceroys and envoys of every obscure constellation we came across, all in an effort to make Emperor Sher's dreams a
reality. But what has His grand vision brought us? One misfortune after another, and an ever-growing number of enemies.
They're in every corner of the galaxy now... it's just a matter of time before they swallow us up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My brother's vision is for an empire that will rule for all eternity, one where there is no fear, and where people do
not lack for anything. The fate of the many will no longer be dictated by the few, no one will enjoy a higher status
than anybody else, and even incompetence will no longer be seen as a crime. And so... it is inevitable that those who
cannot comprehend this grand vision are doomed to be swept aside. This is their fate.&quot;</p>
<p>Princess Gopatha shook her head and spoke with a gentle yet cold tone.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the Intergalactic Anti-Guerrilla War had robbed her of more than just one of her eyes and one of her
arms, because when Faranges looked at her, she did not see the joyful young woman she once knew.</p>
<p>&quot;I trust in brother's decision — he would not act out of mere self-interest. So please, even though it is you, don't say
such things again in the future. Don't speak words that sow doubt.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-14"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-14">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>Surely, even an armada consisting entirely of Eizida-class warships would have a tough job making a dent in a defense as
watertight as this one.</p>
<p>Admiral Geldafried's overconfidence in the greatest technological marvel of the empire meant that she was completely
unaware that the rebels were, at that very moment, closing in on the fatal weakness of their base. The mighty Star
Fortress, Anusharwan — designed personally by Princess Geppeta, and named by Emperor Sher — was now nothing more than a
fragile egg before the rebel fleet, and mother hen was away from the nest.</p>
<p>Bastinu deftly navigated the Lachsz Clipper through the intricate and winding ventilation system, weaving between jets
of poisonous gas and elemental clouds shooting out from holes in the walls, while trying to shake the automatic
mechanical sentries on his tail. His eyes and ears filled with blood and the scene before him merged into a continuous
blur of color and light as the clipper shot ahead at a breathtaking speed. &quot;Now's my chance.&quot; So thought Bastinu to
himself as the propulsion system's energy core came gradually into view. &quot;It's time.&quot; So thought Admiral Geldafried to
herself as she gazed at the flashing sphere of light in the planet's orbit. Then, she gave the order to launch an
indiscriminate assault on the planet. Then, Bastinu launched a fatal attack on the fortress core.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, what I would give to see the look on Princess Geppeta's face right now...&quot; So thought both to themselves,
separately but identically, in that brief moment.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-11"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-11">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Ten years earlier... 25 light years away...</p>
<p>With the nation under the rule of the Suruga Shogunate, cries of anguish filled the streets as the people suffered
bitterly. At that time, the Suruga Shogunate was led by the Seii Tai-Shogun, Imagawa Ujizane. Four years prior, after
finally beheading Demon King Danjouchuu, the Tai-Shogun's own reign of terror began. It was in this time and place that
our free and unrestrained swordmaster wandered the land. His name was Bitchuu Kyuubei, and he was known to the people as
Shinkurou, the vigilante. Bitchuu Kyuubei was not a ronin as such. It is said that he was once the most trusted
strategist for His Excellency the Tai-Shogun, until one day he was framed by a rival. Given the Shogun's paranoid
nature, this left him with no choice but to flee the Shogunate and escape into the wilderness.</p>
<p>Today, Shinkurou was standing on a mountainside gazing into the distance. But what was the object of his gaze? Was it
the vast expanse of open fields? No. Was it the mountain range in the distance? No. Was it the road stretching out ahead
of him? Yes! Although, that's not the full story.</p>
<p>So. What was the object of Shinkurou's gaze, exactly...? The farmers who had paid the swordsman in rice for his services
cowered in fear, too afraid to ask.</p>
<p>It seems that only the silent swordsman himself knew the answer to this question.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-10"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-10">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>&quot;The fall is here. The season of harvest is almost upon us.&quot; The one speaking was Saitou Onisa.</p>
<p>Ninjas are dangerous individuals, experts in self-preservation and in avoiding danger. In times of war and upheaval,
they work as mercenaries for the Daimyo. They are born in war, and they draw their strength from the powerful masters
they work for. Such is the path of the ninja. But it is also the path of the ninja to become displaced and disillusioned
at the end of a war, or to meet their ruin as soon as they lose their powerful backing.</p>
<p>So when the Imagawa Tai-Shogun finally united the country, the ninjas became like hunting dogs that had outlived their
purpose. Most were either executed or drafted into the shogun's army, but some got away, disappeared into the
wilderness, and turned to a life of banditry. That is precisely Saitou Onisa's story.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no rush. Let's wait for the villagers to finish harvesting the grain for us.&quot; The person speaking this time was
called Yonemata Tasuke.</p>
<p>Bandits are either samurai who have grown weary of the warrior's way or farmers fighting to stay alive. They, too, are
born in war. They draw their strength from cunning, and this emboldens them to run amok across across the land. But when
war ends and peace is restored, the source of their power evaporates. Like mayflies, they disappear as quickly as they
came.</p>
<p>Yonemata Tasuke was born into an ordinary farming family, only turning to banditry in his forties. Yet, despite his age,
he took to it with great aplomb, and quickly established himself as a ringleader. The most terrible of all bandits are
those who have themselves suffered terribly under an oppressive hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, we burn everything. Leave no survivors.&quot;</p>
<p>His was the voice of an age of upheaval.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-4"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-4">Volume 5</a></h2>
<p>The terrain of Asada Village was shaped like crescent moon.</p>
<p>Shinkurou had noticed this the very first time he set foot in the marshland.</p>
<p>If he could organize enough villagers to lie in ambush up on the mountain ridge, shielding themselves with the terrain
and attacking downwards from the high ground, defeating the enemy would be easy. Especially since the bandits would be
weary from their journey. Furthermore, the villagers outnumbered the bandits, so surrounding them on all sides would not
be difficult to pull off.</p>
<p>But the biggest obstacle to this plan was the villagers themselves. A small group of easy targets would be needed as
bait to lure the bandits into the valley, but after enduring an age of despotic rule, only to continue to suffer under
the tyrannical and extortionate taxation practices of the present Shogunate, the mentality of individual
self-preservation was deeply ingrained. How was he going to convince anybody to volunteer to be the bait and sacrifice
themselves for everyone else's benefit?</p>
<p>There was one other problem, too. In wartime, a samurai army finding themselves in this situation would be certain to
use fire to make their ambush more effective. The wind from the mountain would make the fire spread quickly, trapping
the enemy in the valley and dealing them a devastating blow.</p>
<p>But this was farming community seeking to keep their land and village safe. There was nothing he could say to convince
them that setting their houses and grain reserves on fire was anything close a good idea. This was completely
understandable, of course, but the fact was that an even worse fate would await them they fail to take the bandits down.</p>
<p>Shinkurou silently sat down and continued to ponder the conundrum.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="a-preliminary-study-of-sangonomiya-folk-belief"><a class="header" href="#a-preliminary-study-of-sangonomiya-folk-belief">A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief</a></h1>
<p>The version of this tale most widely accepted by the people of both Narukami and Watatsumi Island reads as follows:
Around two thousand years ago, the Archon War was drawing to a close in Inazuma. It is said that during this time, the
Great Serpent Orobashi broke the coral branches off his body and guided the people of the deep sea back to the light of
day, and by his grace and pity, he gathered them together to make a living upon the barren island of coral. But in this
world of fickle fortune, humans, puny as they are, often suffered on account of their bitter lives and were gloomy
because of their pain and misfortune. The bright sun, the clear skies, and seas, the clam palace that glittered with
rainbow light, the teachings of the clergy... None of these could assuage the wounds of hunger and disease. The Great
Serpent never forgot his past as one of the defeated, or his oath to never again allow his people to be forsaken. So he
asked the shrine maiden: &quot;Blessed daughter of mine, why do the people of the deep sea weep? Have I not defeated the
Dragonheirs of the Depths and given you the light of day?&quot; The wise shrine maiden replied: &quot;Famine.&quot; The Great Serpent
asked again: &quot;Indeed, it is my failing that has caused you to go hungry. What then, my people, is your request?&quot; The
honest elders replied: &quot;You made a road for us, guiding us to create a nation amidst the blue seas with no need for
robbery, oppression, or tyranny. For this, we are already more than grateful... Yet, to the east of our coral island,
there are lands wider and more fertile still.&quot; &quot;Permit us, great lord, to set foot upon those islands and there carve
out a dominion for ourselves, that our children after us shall have a glorious past, a future in fullness, and a present
without darkness.&quot;</p>
<p>The Great Serpent was silent and made no reply. Narukami it was that dominated the eastern islands, possessing great
strength in war, and those deities defeated thus were all slain to the last, in accordance with the law of the divine
realm. But in the many years that followed, the hungry and diseased people would ask time and again, at last moving the
heart of their god. Thus did the Great Serpent train them to become mighty warriors who commandeered ships and sea
monsters while mastering wave and cloud, leading them in an invasion of the Electro Archon's lands amidst the whistling
of whalesongs... But the people of the sea knew not that Watatsumi Omikami had embarked upon a violent campaign in which
he had no hope of victory, and his purpose was not conquest, but sacrifice. It is said that there were inscriptions
which the shrine maiden hid, upon which were written a prophecy of the certain defeat and the future of humiliation that
awaited this eastern expedition.</p>
<p>Orobashi's true motives are not well-recorded by history. This is merely a hypothesis drawn by those who discovered the
inscriptions: Watatsumi Omikami long knew that he would not have any chance of survival this time, but accepted the
prophecy's result calmly. If he wished to ensure the perpetuation of his people's &quot;faith,&quot; there was but one path —
sacrifice. Even if Watatsumi would pass away, its people would endlessly weave their memories of joy, prosperity,
bitterness, and loss into a united faith. These memories, in turn, would flourish on account of the intense emotions of
a vanquished people forced into shameful submission.</p>
<p>Many among the Watatsumi people now no longer believe that their guiding Omikami has any chance of revival, but their
pride as Watatsumi's people, the pain of watching the body of their god carved up for minerals by their overlord, the
hurt of losing that god... These emotions have passed on from generation to generation, becoming the pillars of
forbearance, resistance, and sacrifice that underpin the faith of Watatsumi's people.</p>
<p>As the author has mentioned, Sangonomiya has an extreme lack of written historical material. As such, these past motives
have all essentially become fictional tales upon which future generations can inscribe any meaning they wish. Thus,
these histories have become &quot;histories of accumulated consciousness&quot; rather than &quot;histories of recorded fact.&quot; The fact
that this collective consciousness has been strengthened and rendered ever more cohesive over time, such that a people
who have lost their beloved god may still actively resist a nation whose faith is in a mighty elemental deity... This
just goes to show that their persistence is hardly some obsolete thing.</p>
<p>Notably, this tendency to give little thought to the &quot;facts&quot; of the past and emphasize the &quot;consciousness&quot; of the
present is a glaring flaw in Watatsumi today. The flames of these hatreds and humiliations, borne and nursed over
hundreds and thousands of years, can be fanned by those with an agenda in leaner years and ultimately bring catastrophe
upon the nation.</p>
<p>But though I say this, while the people of Watatsumi are known for their forbearance, are they really to grin and bear
this mortification endlessly for the sake of survival? With their recent economic exploitation at the hands of the
Kanjou Commission, more and more of the young people of Watatsumi Island are discussing resistance and their complaints.
It seems evident to me that these discussions are not merely about the past, but about the present and future also.</p>
<p>However, there is another version of the legend of Watatsumi Omikami's slaying: While the people of the deep yet dwelt
in the depths, they kept very reliable chronicles, for there was no day or night for them. If they kept no precise
records, they would even forget what time it was. But these chronicles were ordered sealed in Enkanomiya by the Great
Serpent, never to be retrieved. The names of the people of Watatsumi were also not written in the Inazuman style then.
The names and surnames used today by them came about by order of the Great Serpent, who had them learn the traditions of
Narukami. It is said that when Watatsumi Omikami decided to bring the people of the depths out of the waters, he did
this at the instruction of the heavens themselves. For Watatsumi Omikami had once fled into the Dark Sea to avoid the
Archon War, committing a grave sin in the process. Thus perhaps it was upon heaven's order that Orobashi went to his
death — though this cannot be known for sure. Unfortunately, the script once used in Enkanomiya is known to few, and the
books themselves have been hidden there also. Thus, I fear that the truth of the matter shall never see the light of
day. However, these legends that hint at the &quot;truth&quot; are but unimportant anecdotes compared to the aforementioned ones
that imply much about the &quot;consciousness&quot; of the people.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="debates-on-the-viceroy-of-the-east"><a class="header" href="#debates-on-the-viceroy-of-the-east">Debates on the &quot;Viceroy of the East&quot;</a></h1>
<p>Touzannou's name is not known, but it is known that he was of low birth, such that some island folk-tunes name him &quot;the
legacy of moonlight and tide,&quot; or &quot;the forgotten child of the moonlight.&quot; Perhaps he was an orphan, or perhaps he was
the child of people who had been washed ashore by the sea.</p>
<p>But though he had neither name nor surname, nor a clan to protect him as he grew, Watatsumi Omikami accepted this child
nonetheless, just as he had once accepted the lost people trapped in the depths. This boy later apprenticed himself to
Mouun and her sister, learning from them the whalesongs and rites of Watatsumi. His memories were colored by the palace
of coral and clam, the shining schools of fish and the rainbow-hued mackerel, and his body was tempered by the rugged
reefs and endless waves, becoming strong and swift.</p>
<p>The songs of the Yuna Clan say that when the boy had grown into a young man, he was invited by Mouun the shrine maiden
to swim together amidst tides lit by moon and stars alike. In the ebb and flow of the entwined lights, the young man
sensed the words and emotions of the sea creatures, and hearing the shrine maiden's gentle, mournful whispers, he
decided his future course.</p>
<p>It is said that after this night-time excursion, the young man comprehended the sword styles known as &quot;Getsumouun&quot; and
&quot;Yuushio.&quot; Though he would not have any descendants, these sword techniques would be taught amongst the warriors of
Watatsumi and passed down from generation to generation, thus never becoming extinct. In Watatsumi Island, which lacks
traditions of swordsmanship, these two styles remain effective and practical techniques that can prove perilous to any
foe.</p>
<p>When Watatsumi Omikami set off on the eastern expedition from which there would be no return, the young man headed up
the vanguard and took a place known then to the Watatsumi people as Touzan. Thus was he given the honorific of Touzannou
by Watatsumi Omikami himself. However, this valiant &quot;king of the eastern mountain&quot; would become known as a brutal,
savage &quot;wicked king,&quot; or Akuou, to the people of Yashiori Island.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Akuou and his lord were both judged by the Musou no Hitotachi, and Mouun, who once trod upon the waves with
him on that moonlit night, was lost amidst a storm of black feathers, her people bewailing her fate. And when the dust
settled, things had not turned out as they might have hoped.</p>
<p>Notably, people still call outstanding warriors &quot;the scions of Touzannou,&quot; although the young and presumptuous Touzannou
himself never had the opportunity to join himself to the one he loved, nor would they ever enjoy a peaceful future
together.</p>

<p><strong>Phantasmagoria</strong></p>
<p>&quot;... The dream lives on.&quot;</p>
<p>Such words surely must appear the midst of every tale, and they are largely the words of the Kaiserin of the
Immernachtreich. This, surely, is not the enigma that concerns the greatest majority of readers, but we must still start
here nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>Ozvaldo Hrafnavins</strong></p>
<p>The mighty lord of the Nachtraben. If Fischl's strength in battle might be considered a ten, and the Beasts of the World
should have an average of fifteen, then Ozvaldo's strength may be considered thirteen. His great power was on display
when he destroyed Dämmerung in Volume 1.</p>
<p>*That said, the Nachtvorhang is itself the nemesis of Dämmerung anyway. As for the feelings that Ozvaldo holds towards
*Fischl, Mr. Nine does not believe it to be romance, but more likely a form of imprinting common to bird-kindred.</p>
<p>(Editor-in-Chief's Note: Regardless of what the author says, dear readers, you are free to interpret the personal
relationships of the characters from Immernachtreich however you like.)</p>
<p>Aside from this, the title &quot;Prince Nachtraben&quot; is not a particularly high-flown one, considering that the night ravens
have always been known for being conspirators and bearers of curses. Ozvaldo likely insisted on this title, for how
could a mere &quot;King of the Night&quot; call himself thus before the Immernachtreich?</p>
<p><strong>Beast of the World: Gesamtkunstwerk</strong></p>
<p>In certain probabilities, this is the Beast of the World that the Immernachtreich would be faced with in this cycle. Its
battle strength is around thirty. In a distant causality, if the philosopher Zarathustra was not chosen, then the opera
writer would have gained victory in the contest over the will of the world. Once Gesamtkunstwerk takes the stage in the
opera theater of the apocalypse, many more Beasts of the World that reside within the center of the universe will
inexorably begin to appear as well. In the final volume, the weakness of the Beast of the World: Saint of Seven Tears
(whose combat strength was ten, and therefore equal to Fischl) was quite out of the ordinary, and the Saint merely wept
for Zarathustra at first, a choice that seems undeserving of any blame. Both Zarathustra and The Musician exist to give
praise unto the Prinzessin der Vererteilung [sic]. One proclaims the agony she suffers in her heart, while the other
proclaims the grandeur of her travails. The Prinzessin, of course, will not favor the latter, for of such things would
she be ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>Sommernachtgarten</strong></p>
<p>It is said that those who are highly skilled in the magical arts will possess their own unique domains of consciousness.
Their loves, hatreds, yearnings, jealousies, adherence, and passions of the soul will be stored here. In the fictional
tales of other novels, this space is called Summerland. The Sommernachtgarten of the Prinzessin is something in this
vein. That this concept was never well-explored in the end remains quite the pity.</p>
<p><strong>The Suspected Eternal Return</strong></p>
<p>Quite a few of the finer points of the tale have caused people to wonder if the Kaiserin of the Immernachtreich once
experienced all that Fischl has. Fischl's father is undoubtedly not a mere shade. He is majestic and mighty, and helps
Fischl to dispel her confusions. As for Fischl's mother, the Kaiserin, her actions and deeds show her to have quite an
interesting character indeed. But she will only speak one line, which is, as was noted earlier in this text, &quot;the dream
lives on.&quot; In the final volume, Fischl's mother had already faded away, and so this volume, naturally, did not have this
preceding line. But as the universe entered its denouement and all things within it flowed into the Immernachtreich, she
spoke another line of enigmatic intent— &quot;Find meaning somewhere. The night deepens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Find meaning somewhere. The night deepens, but the dream lives on.&quot; Dear readers, I hope that you will all find
happiness in this world where the sun still rises each day.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Questions and Answers</strong></p>
<p>Q: Dear Mr. Nine, may I ask what the relationship between the Celestial Emperor's daughter in &quot;Legend of the Shattered
Halberd&quot; and Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort is?<br />
A: I felt that the tragedy that unfolded toward the end of Volume 5 of
&quot;Legend of the Shattered Halberd&quot; was due to the male protagonist, and the Celestial Emperor's daughter's attraction to
him. As such, I wanted to write a Prinzessin der Vererteilung [sic] who had no need of a male protagonist. This was the
scaffold that would come to be &quot;Flowers for Princess Fischl.&quot; Eventually, though, I did write the sixth volume of
&quot;Halberd,&quot; which rescued the ending. There was probably some cross-pollination in the process of writing two series at
the same time, but I was personally quite pleased with the result.</p>
<p>Q: In a fight between Mir's dad (Khan the Asura and his sword Laevatain) at full strength versus Gesamtkunstwerk, who
would come out on top?<br />
A: I originally intended to refuse to answer this question, but the editor-in-chief said that
she'd axe my next manuscript if I didn't. In which case, my Mora would be on Gesamtkunstwerk.</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Nine, you mentioned in &quot;Farewell Frau Welt&quot; that you were suffering from hair loss. Are you doing better now?<br />
A: Could the Yae Publishing House not accept this sort of question? And do people actually read what gets added in these
new editions?<br />
(Editor-in-Chief's Note: Oh, but the readers are very concerned about you! And yes, they are also very
concerned with the purchase of new editions.)</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lets-go-dodoco"><a class="header" href="#lets-go-dodoco">Let's Go, Dodoco</a></h1>
<p>&quot;All Dodocos must someday ride the wind and the waves and go on an adventure.&quot; A gentle and beautiful mother once said
that. And just as she had predicted, our Dodoco was so happy when its best friend, Klee, said that she was going to the
nation of lightning for an adventure! Of course, Dodoco loves eating delicious food with Klee at Good Hunter, and loves
listening to the bards sing. But Dodoco loves counting the stars in the sky and twisting flowers into garlands together
with Klee more. After all, all Dodocos long to ride the wind and waves on an adventure.</p>
<p>To get to Inazuma, one needs to pass through the wild winds and pass over the great waves. But Dodoco did not fear the
howling wind, for that was the blessing of the Anemo Archon. Dodoco did not worry about the rolling waves either, for it
was very brave.</p>
<p>Of course, Dodoco didn't want Klee to have to brave such dangers. But as bestest friends, they were bound to protect
each other. And Dodoco didn't want to be apart from Klee anyway. Without Klee, adventures would be like Sweet Flowers
that cannot bloom, lonely and sad things. Even if Dodoco were to cover every inch of Teyvat by land or sea, it would be
meaningless. So there was no point hesitating. Dodoco and its best friend Klee were off on an adventure! If they rode on
a boat, they wouldn't be able to fly freely in the sky, or swim happily in the sea... But they'd have Klee's smile and
Albedo's stories. And that was a good trade!</p>
<p><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/2/29/Let&#x27;s_Go_Dodoco!_Illustration_1.png" alt="Illustration 1" /></p>
<p>In Inazuma, the nation of lightning, the flowers and grasses are all purple, and the fish and the birds are also purple.
Everything is purple! Albedo would probably run out of purple paint trying to paint it all. Unfortunately, he couldn't
be around to draw with Klee and Dodoco. Albedo was an adult, after all. And sometimes adults have to do adult-things.
Fortnately, Dodoco still had Klee! Klee would often find happy things to do. As long as Dodoco was with Klee, Dodoco
would never be bored.</p>
<p>Klee also had lots of friends in Inazuma, like Mr. Honorary Knight, Paimon, and Yoimiya. And so they all joined Dodoco
for most fun adventure ever in Inazuma! Hooray for adventure!</p>
<p>Mr. Honorary Knight took Dodoco up the tall, tall Mt. Yougou. When they got to the Sacred Sakura, they were so tired
from all that climbing that they fell asleep. And when they woke up, everyone had grown wings like a tengu! Klee's wings
were red, Yoimiya's were gold, and Mr. Honorary Knight's were blue. As for Paimon... Paimon can fly without wings, so
Paimon didn't grow any. Everyone opened their wings up, causing a huge gust of wind to roll forth. Shooom~ And the
shrine maiden's hair was all messed up. Oh no, she looked angry! Better run, quick!</p>
<p>Ah, adventure truly was fun... But with a <em>growl</em>, Klee's stomach started calling out. Oh no! How could they have
forgotten? Eating is an important part of adventuring too! Om nom nom nom~ And so everyone ate the onigiri they brought
along, and they all had a great time. Dodoco and Paimon finished their share very quickly, and as the very, very full
Dodoco looked Klee's smile, it couldn't help but think— Meeting Klee and the others is the most hap-happiest thing that
ever happened to Dodoco!</p>

<p>Oh, yes. If you are reading this, you too are surely part of this big adventure. Adventuring together, laughing
together, enjoying good food together... If you experienced this together with everyone, then you must be their good

<p>While everyone was happily watching the fireworks, Yoimiya said: &quot;As long as our imaginations don't run dry, our minds
will be freer than all others.&quot; And Klee blurted out: &quot;We'll always be best friends!&quot; See, Dodoco was so happy to be
together with its good friends. And now, you are Dodoco's good friends too. So you, too, should go on a grand adventure

<h2 id="volume-1-17"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-17">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
<p>Stories relating to memory always seem to have to do with those moments where you gain something and lose it straight
away.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how I came to write about it, it's hardly the most exciting story.</p>
<p>That night, I was drinking and killing time at the Uyuu Restaurant when I happened to run into an old friend that I
hadn't seen in forever. I don't know when she arrived, but at some point I suddenly noticed her sitting there in one of
the booths.</p>
<p>&quot;My, my, now, who could this be, sitting there in such a good mood, yet drinking all alone?&quot;</p>
<p>Since she was asking, I thought I might as well mutter something in response: &quot;The best liquor comes at the highest
price, and sometimes that price is waiting alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pff, I've definitely heard that one before... Still as boring as ever, I see.&quot; Thus remarked the chief editor as she
stood there with a liquor cup in hand, looking very enthusiastic about the prospect of having a drink or two. &quot;Why not
earn yourself some drinking money? It's not like you've got anything better to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tonight, though, the drinks are on me.&quot; She laughed, and reiterated this a couple more times.</p>
<p>&quot;You're back.&quot; I watched as the evening breeze brought a few flower petals from the Sacred Sakura and landed them in her
cup, making ripples that disturbed the reflection of the moon. Overcome by a strong sense of déjà vu, my mouth took it
upon itself to proceed with an utterance that would prove to be something of an embarrassment to my brain.</p>
<p>&quot;You're drunk.&quot; She didn't look very happy to hear that, and retorted with a firm and defiant tone in her voice. But her
countenance quickly changed again as she placed her cup down on the table and let out a sigh: &quot;I wasn't even born yet
when she left.&quot;</p>
<p>And I was still in my youth back then.</p>
<p>&quot;You must be the only one still able to recite the stories she once told.&quot;</p>
<p>And just like that, I found myself roped into writing for the Yae Publishing House one more time. It's quite amusing,
now I think about it. To my faithful readers, please don't be upset. This should not be taken to mean that I am
committed to no longer writing save for when it becomes a selfish indulgence. After all, there's some great liquor
that's soon to decrease in price, and I have to make sure I'm prepared. Besides, I have to pay the chief editor back for
the wine she so kindly bought me that night.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-15"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-15">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>Forgive my garrulousness, but there are still some things to get out of the way before the story begins in earnest. Why
the &quot;new&quot; chronicles of the six kitsune? Naturally, the word &quot;new&quot; here presumes the existence of an &quot;old.&quot; This book is
a slightly revised edition of Urakusai's Chronicles of the Six Kitsune, which enjoyed a period of great popularity five
hundred years ago. I possess but limited writing skills, and can only hope that Urakusai and my other readers will
peruse these pages with forgiving eyes. Urakusai was already famous when I was but a small child. By that time, the
Saiguu had already taken great interest in Urakusai's literary abilities and expertise on tea, making Urakusai one of
the most cultured and sophisticated of all the kitsune. Unfortunately, that is all in the past now. Urakusai made a
grave mistake and had to leave. It has now been 500 years since then...</p>
<p>Without further ado, the story of the New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune begins on the towering Mt. Yougou. Legend has it
that in the time of the Great Kitsune Hakushin, she had six apprentices. All were greatly skilled in magic and in
shape-shifting. Day-to-day, they were tasked with assisting their matriarch, Hakushin, in managing the shrine and
defending Mt. Yougou.</p>
<p>The eldest of the six was Itaru the Black Fox, who, unlike most other females, was built as broad as a bear and as
strong as a tiger. She also had a wild and unruly personality. One day, she was being drunk and disorderly in the main
hall of the shrine, and destroyed a shintai that represented the Shogun. Incensed, Hakushin banished Itaru from the
mountain for a period of much-needed self-reflection. But Black Fox Itaru was all too happy to leave the mountain
behind. She put Hakushin's warnings completely out of her mind, found a bottle of good-quality liquor, and headed
straight for the nearest village to look for trouble.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-12"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-12">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Continuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru was on her way to the village looking for trouble when she saw two women
standing at the side of the road dressed like lumberjacks. Both had three blades hanging from their waist: a
seven-foot-long nodachi, a kodachi, and a wakizashi. They were armed to the teeth, and they weren't hiding it.</p>
<p>As her big, bulky silhouette approached from a distance, the ground shook and dust went flying with each step she took —
all of which put the two women on high alert. They grasped the hilts of their blades, ready to draw them at any moment,
and asked in unison:</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you? Are you a youkai!?&quot;</p>
<p>The silhouette answered:</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, that's exactly what I am!&quot;</p>
<p>Without hesitation, the two women immediately drew their swords and stepped forward, intending to slay Itaru. But this
was one youkai they had underestimated. She dodged their attacks in a single step, grabbed their wrists, and twisted
them as she turned sideways, sending both of their seven-foot-long nodachi clattering to the ground. Alarmed by the
pain, the two reached for their kodachi, but they were too late. Itaru sent one of them flying to the ground with an
almighty slap, while placing the other into a headlock. Then, she grabbed the one under her arm by the scruff of the
neck and lifted her up into the air, placing her foot on the other's chest to pin her to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;The Twin Oni of Tokaku? Looks like neither of you have learned anything from the beating I gave you last year for
harassing the villagers!&quot;</p>
<p>When the two bandits heard this, they panicked and started begging for their lives. Black Fox Itaru threw them to the
ground and begin to speak:</p>
<p>&quot;Fair enough. Well, I'm a masterless youkai now that I've been banished from the mountain by Hakushin. Why don't the two
of you join me? We'll go around helping those in need. It'll be fun!&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-11"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-11">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>Continuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru successfully tamed the bandit duo, the Twin Oni of Tokaku, and the three
set off on their new journey of chivalry.</p>
<p>As the chivalric trio was resting in Konda Village, they ran into a mother and her daughter. After striking up a
conversation, they learned that the mother's surname was Youzan, the daughter's given name was Yui, and that both were
musicians from the distant Seirai Island visiting Inazuma City to join in the festival. On their way, they had been
scammed by a Lavender Melon seller from the village: He had offered them a few melons to quench their thirst, ostensibly
out of the goodness of his heart, before then insisting that they purchase more of his melons at an extortionate price.
But touring musicians aren't exactly wealthy, and they couldn't afford to spend the entirety of their budget for the
return trip on overpriced melons... The Twin Oni of Tokaku are an impulsive pair. Upon hearing the story, they instantly
began fuming with rage, and unanimously decided that they needed to teach this dishonest merchant a lesson by cutting
him into tiny pieces. But Black Fox Itaru had another idea, and spoke up to stop the two sisters:</p>
<p>&quot;Enough. I know what to do.&quot;</p>
<p>She comforted the mother and daughter:</p>
<p>&quot;You two have nothing to worry about. Just watch, I'll talk to the merchant, and he'll come to his senses.&quot;</p>
<p>Itaru marched off to look for the dishonest merchant.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-5"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-5">Volume 5</a></h2>
<p>Continuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru marched off to talk some sense into the dishonest merchant.</p>
<p>The Lavender Melon merchant, Dozaemon, was once a samurai. But with peace having prevailed in Inazuma for so long, his
sword skills offered no further use, so he became a merchant in the village instead. After learning a few swindler's
tricks, such as extortion and intimidation, he found that because he looked so fierce, no one dared confront him no
matter how much he took from them. Over time, he had become one of the wealthiest people in the village.</p>
<p>On this day, Dozaemon was relaxing in front of his shop when all of a sudden, he saw dust flying and felt the ground
shaking. Then, a shadow large enough to dwarf his shop slowly fell over his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! I want to buy some melons!&quot;</p>
<p>Dozaemon narrowed his eyes and sized up the muscular, fierce-looking, and ill-mannered customer standing over him like
an executioner, before finally realizing — oh, she's a woman...!</p>
<p>&quot;How many?&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently, this customer was in no hurry to answer. She was too busy admiring his wakizashi, which was lying on the
chopping board:</p>
<p>&quot;Mighty fine blade you got there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You got that right. I'll have you know I'm from a samurai clan. It's only fitting that I keep an heirloom nearby.&quot;</p>
<p>Dozaemon went along with the conversation, unaware of where it was heading.</p>
<p>&quot;Shame. It's wasted on chopping melons.&quot;</p>
<p>Dozaemon sensed that this was an intentionally barbed remark, and he did not look happy about it:</p>
<p>&quot;What's with all the chit-chat? Are you buying melons or not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I am, I am.&quot; Itaru smiled at Dozaemon as a gesture of apology.</p>
<p>&quot;Four pounds of chopped Lavender Melon, without the skins, please.&quot;</p>
<p>Dozaemon's suspicions were aroused, but he did not question the request. He promptly chopped four pounds of melon and
placed it onto the scale.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, how come your scale's all wonky?&quot;</p>
<p>Dozaemon grasped his blade the moment Itaru said this.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, isn't that something—this scale's got a mind of its own!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Glad you're so amused. But it's time to pay up now.&quot;</p>
<p>Dozaemon could no longer hold back his anger. The time for pleasantries was over it was time to talk sense.</p>
<p>&quot;Heh, I don't have a problem with paying you what you're due... I'm just not sure you'd be able to take it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don't you worry — I'll take whatever you've got to give!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You sure about that!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try me!&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Itaru yelled &quot;take this!&quot; and threw a bag full of Mora directly at Dozaemon's face. Dozaemon didn't react in
time, and took the full force of the impact square on the nose. He fell backwards onto the ground as his precious
wakizashi went flying from his hand and fell beside him. On closer inspection, his nose had been squashed completely
flat by the bag of Mora: It looked just like the kind of pouch one might use to store a pipe, only without the pipe
inside.</p>
<p>Itaru walked over and pressed her foot down on the dishonest merchant's chest. Without a word, she hit Dozaemon so hard
it felt like a Liyue martial arts tournament was being hosted on his face. With great difficulty, he fought to get back
on his feet, but just as he had stood up and grabbed his blade, Itaru noticed and landed another ferocious blow to his
head. This time, it hit so hard that a pair of tanuki ears popped out in response. He began to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>Itaru burst out laughing at the sight in front of her. So, the merchant is a youkai in disguise and a filthy tanuki at
that!</p>
<p>Itaru promptly confiscated the tanuki's stolen wakizashi, distributed most of its ill-gotten wealth among the villagers,
and handed the rest to the mother and daughter who had fallen victim to its scheme earlier. Itaru spared the tanuki's
life albeit not without some reluctance and continued on her way.</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-4"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-4">Volume 6</a></h2>
<p>We shall bring the anecdotes of Black Fox Itaru to a close for now. Please forgive me for nagging, but I have some old
matters I wish to comment on. Now, it is no longer well-known how exactly Urakusai angered Lady Saiguu at that time.
However, Lady Yae did offer to tell me some snippets of the history she experienced after having between two and eight
drinks. This is a novel, of course, so I naturally would like to turn these words into a story of what history has not
recorded. When the Kitsune Saiguu departed from the Hakushin Lands to take up her post at the Grand Narukami Shrine,
Lady Yae still had yet to be born. As such, her early years were filled with stories and tales about Saiguu, and she
loved and respected her greatly. This is also why Lady Yae would eventually come to the Grand Narukami Shrine herself
after embarking on her own travels.</p>
<p>Due to their closeness by blood, Lady Saiguu doted upon Lady Yae quite a bit, though Lady Yae speaks as little as
possible about those times as she may nowadays... —And while I as a novelist write to entertain, I shall refrain from
revealing too much about Lady Yae's past, lest I suffer under the editor-in-chief's mighty pen.</p>
<p>But back to Urakusai. It is no longer clear how Urakusai angered Lady Saiguu back in the day, but it is known that his
deeds may have had some connection to the later incursion of the Abyss. However, after Urakusai had been driven out, the
Kitsune Saiguu would no longer dwell at the Grand Narukami Shrine, but would instead set up permanent residence at
Tenshukaku.</p>
<p>&quot;A disaster that will engulf heaven and earth is coming. My duty is to defend the people and protect our lord, and so I
must go to the Shogun's side.&quot;</p>
<p>When Lady Saiguu departed the second time, Lady Yae was but a young girl. The person she had pursued all this time now
left her again. It was not until the untimely disaster swept across the archipelago that we understood the meaning of
Lady Saiguu's words... But it was too late, and things had not turned out as we would have wished. This time, Lady
Saiguu left a third time. This time, she departed forever.</p>
<p>Five centuries may seem long to mortals, but the joys and sorrows left by the things that happened during that time,
whether to fleeting existences or enduring ones, are not easy to erase.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pretty-please-kitsune-guuji"><a class="header" href="#pretty-please-kitsune-guuji">Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?</a></h1>
<p>&quot;Welcome back, Almighty Shogun!&quot;</p>
<p>Says Yae Masako, who is kneeling on the ground respectfully. She is dressed in a red-white shrine maiden outfit, her
fluffy fox ears twitching slightly, and beneath them is a face that all looks up to. &quot;You are back. I asked you to help
patrol the territory half a month ago. How's it going then?&quot; &quot;Oops, I shouldn't ask about work when you've just
returned. Well, as usual, are you going to have dinner first or take a bath first? Or do you prefer...&quot; &quot;What? 'As
usual'? You never greeted me this way when I came back in the past.&quot; Hearing my response, the figure dressed in red and
white gives a content smile and goes on, &quot;I wanted to cheer you up a bit seeing your tired face. Now, I gotta get back
to cooking. I made your favorite Butter Crab today!&quot; &quot;Yay! Butter Crab, my favorite Butter Crab!&quot;</p>
<p>I, the Raiden Shogun, whose signature line is &quot;Yay!&quot; and whose favorite food is Butter Crab, spend most of my time
with... Um, basically, there are only two kinds of people in my life: nobodies, and the one with fluffy ears and a
teasing voice. Yae Masako, Guuji of the Grand Kaminaru Shrine, descendant of Kitsune lineage, and Eternity's servant and
friend... She goes by too many names to remember. In the eyes of the people of Inazuma, she is almost as unapproachable
and unfathomable as I.</p>
<p>Yet that very Yae Masako is intently watching the Butter Crab as it is being baked. Yes, simply put, I, the Raiden
Shogun is being looked after by Guuji Yae Masako.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I had already got used to this way of life. Every time I just randomly swing my sword, she'll
enthusiastically clap her hands and say: &quot;Good girl!&quot; Every time I look for some snacks to go with &quot;Shogun Almighty:
Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power,&quot; she can always produce delicious milk tea and cake in no time. She carefully
extinguishes every flicker of potential annoyance as if she is maintaining Eternity. For me, she is like a kitsune from
the legend who grants every wish of mine. &quot;Butter Crab is ready! Before enjoying the food, allow me to get back to our
previous question about patrolling...&quot;</p>
<p>Masako turns around, setting the steaming-hot Butter Crab on the table, its scent soon permeating the room. But I can't
bring myself to answer her question — to be honest, this is the reason why I am so down today. Like I said, there are
only Masako and other people in my world. All of them, except Masako, would do the same thing upon seeing me: They would
bow to the ground in the most respectful manner and address me as &quot;Almighty Shogun.&quot; When I walk away, they will then
straighten up with a sigh of relief. It doesn't matter if they are someone's wife, father, boyfriend, or girlfriend, it
doesn't matter if they are someone's boss, servant, or hero. They always put on the same face in front of me — one that
exhibits the reverence and fear for the Almighty Shogun. Yet none know how I equally fear that very face of theirs. Who
wouldn't? Just think about it: thousands of people putting on the same face in your presence.</p>
<p>That is why I rely so much on Masako. That is why I couldn't reject her request. Although I can't do it, I will always
go out to work as long as she wants me to. To be honest, I don't know how to deal with those identical faces — thousands
of them. I don't want to, and I can't. As long as I get to avoid making contact with them, I don't mind being called a
loser Shogun. But still, although I don't mind that, I can't face Masako's questions. &quot;Why are you so quiet, Almighty
Shogun? Is it because... you did nothing at all after walking out of Tenshukaku and then came back in the evening?&quot;
There was not a trace of reprimand to be heard in Masako's voice, but that made me even more ashamed when facing her
questions. &quot;Alright then. Rest is also important. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll excuse myself. Enjoy your
fill of the crab.&quot; Masako turns around and leaves.</p>
<p>Somehow, the Butter Crab today tasted like... nothing. Soon I'll know why. The Almighty Shogun is invincible, but the
invincible Almighty Shogun could be defeated by a cold. Not long after I ate the Butter Crab, I collapsed into bed with
a severe headache. The pain is nothing, but something more grievous has happened: On any other day, I could just rest my
head on Masako's knees and fall asleep to her singing voice. But Masako isn't around today. My chamber feels icy-cold,
but my forehead feels fiery-hot. This time, no one is sitting by my bedside.</p>
<p>She has her own matters to attend to. She is not only my kitsune but also the Guuji of the shrine. Maybe she is very mad
now, or perhaps she is wondering if it is worthwhile to spend so much effort on the Shogun who always has the line
&quot;Yay!&quot; upon her lips. With such a question in mind, I fall asleep.</p>
<p>I have a dream, in which Masako is still wearing her signature smile, a tea bowl in hand. &quot;I brewed this drink called
Rainbow Aster. I just went to Ritou and bought some Calla Lilies from Mondstadt. Mix them with mint and we have this
drink that can cure your cold. Now drink it.&quot; Perhaps because I am dreaming, I don't have the strength to brace myself
up. &quot;Ah, looks like you can't support yourself. Allow me.&quot; She feeds me the Rainbow Aster in a way that I'd never dare
to imagine. I wake with a start, my head still reeling from the sheer shock of the scene just now. Masako is probably
still mad at me for slacking off.</p>
<p>It's just... Why does it feel so sweet at the corner of my lips?</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="princess-mina-of-the-fallen-nation"><a class="header" href="#princess-mina-of-the-fallen-nation">Princess Mina of the Fallen Nation</a></h1>
<h2 id="volume-1-18"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-18">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>Thirteen years of peace were had before the era of warring states began. The nations of the north, furthest from the
epicenter, at last became infected by the spirit of the age, hurling themselves into the flames of war. As it is with
most wars, a loser would be decided after a fierce conflict. Their cities were cast down into flaming rubble, and their
nobles and their supporters fled into the mountains. Such a backdrop is hardly anything special.</p>
<p>But into that inflection point of an era strode a wandering samurai dressed in luxurious robes. No, rather than
&quot;luxurious,&quot; perhaps it was more accurate to say that these robes were... Yes, that's right. It was a man dressed as a
woman. In contrast, this samurai was accompanied by a petite girl wearing a haori that was large to the point of
incredulity. In any case, they were a suspicious pair for sure. However, the two of them sauntered up to the checkpoint
at the foot of the mountains as if unaware of this fact. Of course, they were immediately stopped by the ashigaru
guarding the checkpoint. &quot;Who are you?&quot; This was a standard thing to say, but it was also an honest question in this
case. &quot;As you can see, we're just ordinary passers-by.&quot; It was a reply with no powers of persuasion. But the ashigaru
who asked almost seemed to hesitate at the sheer lack of doubt in the samurai's tone. &quot;Well, uh, could I ask you to come
with me anyway?&quot; &quot;Ah. That didn't work, huh..&quot; The samurai almost seemed disappointed. Suddenly, three ashigaru fell to
the ground. &quot;You planned to do this all along, didn't you? You horrible knave.&quot; The girl grumbled softly from the rear.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-16"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-16">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>&quot;That's not it.&quot; These words burst out suddenly. In the nameless mountain shrine, the black-haired princess sat still,
her face flickering between light and shadow in the face of a flame. &quot;What do you mean 'that's not it'?&quot; Came the reply,
almost as a conditioned reflex. &quot;What I mean, you dumb samurai, is: don't you have any thoughts concerning me, the
princess who brings destruction?&quot; &quot;Thoughts? Well, I think you're quite the character, for one.&quot; &quot;I don't mean
'thoughts' in that sense.&quot; Princess Mina sounded quite exasperated now. &quot;I mean with regards to saving me.&quot; &quot;Strictly
speaking, I didn't save you.&quot; The samurai corrected. &quot;At that time, you ordered me to take you away in your capacity as
princess. In that sense, you saved yourself.&quot; &quot;Oh, is that how you see it?&quot; An expected reply. Well, the samurai
thought, it had been worth a shot trying to dodge responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;In any case, this 'princess who brings destruction' nonsense... Hah. Isn't that just an excuse for making war?&quot; The
samurai's lackadaisical tone shifted. &quot;Also,&quot; The samurai turned around, void-like eyes now aflame. &quot;'Destroying the
world' is an utterly stupid concept. You'll understand soon enough.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-13"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-13">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>People call war hell, but most are just describing it as such. But what appeared before their eyes could only truly be
called &quot;hell.&quot; The desolate earth, the withered trees, and people like the shambling dead. It was like the life had been
wrung from this place. &quot;Huh.&quot; The samurai picked a husk of a leaf. It crumbled into dust immediately, floating away on
the wind. &quot;It seems like the life has literally been wrung out from this place.&quot;</p>
<p>Conflict had raged around the capital for over a century now. After the first decade, the resources and riches of the
various warring nations had already been all but spent. The thing that had sustained the bloodshed for so long was
something known as Nakura's Hex. Nakura's Hex was a terrifying sorcery that sucked the life of all living things and the
land itself dry, giving it unto powerful samurai and feeding the war effort. And those who used such depraved magics to
dominate the land were scoundrels known as the Nakura Daimyo. The Daimyo vied for dominance, but no matter who won, the
earth would be further robbed of life. This was the true face of the war that had raged for nearly a century now. &quot;And
the ones who created the Hex are the Onmyouji who dwell in the Sky Tower at the center of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Ignoring Princess Mina, who had wavered at the sight before her eyes, the samurai continued faintly, &quot;O 'princess who
brings destruction'... Has this world not already been destroyed?&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-12"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-12">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>The nation of Kogami — a lifeless wasteland as far as the eye could see. The barren fields stretched out into the
horizon around a large sand dune where the two samurai faced each other. One of them is our protagonist, and shall be
named the green samurai to distinguish him from his compatriot. The other is a new arrival to the story. We shall name
him the pale samurai. If this were a swashbuckler's tale, then they would have already taken up battle stances. But the
two were not here to have a decisive match. They were just facing each other.</p>
<p>&quot;Came back from hell, did you?&quot; The pale samurai said, the weight of time unknowable lying between them. &quot;Nostalgic,
isn't it?&quot; The green samurai seemed quite happy. &quot;I don't get nostalgic over such things.&quot; The pale samurai interrupted
rudely. The green samurai closed their eyes, as if sinking into the abyss of the past.</p>
<p>&quot;'This will all end as long as we defeat the evil overlords.' That's what we believed then. Naive fools that we were —
that was just the beginning of the nightmare.&quot; &quot;The thirteen samurai banded together to defeat the Nakura Daimyo who had
been destroying this nation.&quot; &quot;But Kogami did not revive with the Daimyo gone, and the life-force of the land continued
to bleed away.&quot; &quot;Not only that — Kogami, now bereft of its ruler, became a paradise for those who would plunder it.&quot;
&quot;The heroes who had defeated the wicked overlord could not protect it in the end either.&quot; &quot;In the end, only two
escaped.&quot; &quot;...Hey now, cut the reminiscence out for a second. We've got things to settle, don't we?&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-6"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-6">Volume 5</a></h2>
<p>&quot;I want to save this world!&quot; Princess Mina said. &quot;I've told you this many times before. There's no such thing as 'saving
this world.' Now, this hasn't stopped idiots like me from trying, of course. But this world... it's doomed.&quot; &quot;I don't
care. I'm a princess. Aren't princesses born to save the world?&quot; &quot;No, I've never heard of any story that goes like that.
And last I heard, you were the princess who brings destruction.&quot; &quot;Last I heard, someone said that this 'destruction' is
actually the birth of new life.&quot; &quot;Well, I don't know where you heard that one, but such beliefs are old hat by now. If
you wrote this drivel nowadays, people would chuck it into the nation of Tokoyo, and that would be for the best.&quot; (The
Princess covers her ears)</p>
<p>At the top of the Sky Tower, the samurai and princess argued in futility, as if no one was watching. Well, I say that,
but in fact there were quite a few other folk about dressed in the garb of onmyouji. &quot;So, uh, as you all know, Nakura's
Hex was originally created to preserve the vitality of a world that was slowly declining.&quot; As if unable to stand the
conversation — and also to push the plot forward in their role as an NPC — the oldest onmyouji finally spoke. &quot;And that
which can utilize this stored vitality...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, could you get these thoughts out of your head?&quot; The samurai didn't seem to have heard the wizened onmyouji at all.
How long was this farce going to continue?</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-5"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-5">Volume 6</a></h2>
<p>&quot;So, was the world saved?&quot; At the story's end, the samurai walked amidst the boundless desert. The Sky Tower's plans
were probably complete by now, and vitality remaining in the world had all been stored up. There was no knowing if a new
world had been created, but this one was most certainly done for. Ah, what could one expect of a princess destined to
destroy the world? &quot;Might as well destroy another world... if it exists.&quot; And so the samurai embarked on a new journey.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Seek first forgiveness from Narukami in the skies above, and then from Watatsumi on the land below. Then, recite
prayers to quench the gods' anger.&quot; The aforementioned ritual must be carried out before any sacrifices, exorcisms,
blessings or spell-rites can take place. The same holds true for this Cleansing Ritual.</p>
<p>The Thunder Sakura were born from grafted Sacred Sakura branches. They are offshoots of Narukami's own spirit and
connect the Grand Shrine to all others. In those days, catastrophe rocked the heavens and demons roamed the earth. The
land was defiled, ferocious foes abounded, and small devils wreaked havoc. Thus, the branches were broken off at the
Grand Shrine and transplanted across the land to cleanse the filth. Years passed, and damage accumulated. The Cleansing
Ritual must thus be performed to calm the chaos.</p>
<p>The Thunder Sakura purification must take place once every 60 years. The ritual may also be divided into a minor and
major cleansing. After performing the minor cleansing a few times, the major cleansing must then be carried out. During
the minor cleansing, one must first seek forgiveness from sky and land, tie up a rope to form a barrier, and recite the
&quot;kashikomi.&quot; Next, all the filth must be sealed up inside the barrier and the poisoned root nodules must be isolated
from any mortal dwelling. Finally, a ward must be used to suppress all the filth. This must be performed separately in
five different places on Narukami Island. The purpose of this minor cleansing ritual is to isolate the defilement and
thus procure some years of peace.</p>
<p>During the major cleansing, one must first seek forgiveness from sky and land. Then five wards representing the eyes,
the mouth, the nose, the hands and the feet must be retrieved, destroying the barriers created by the minor cleansing in
the process. The filth must then be eradicated by a powerful spell. The purpose of the major cleansing ritual is to wipe
out the defilement and to completely eradicate the filth.</p>

<p>Sangonomiya was once an ocean abyss, until the Great Serpent came, forming a vortex with its spiral movements, and
fashioning the coral into an island. Thus the people of Sangonomiya named their island Watatsumi, meaning &quot;god of the
sea,&quot; for the Great Serpent was their god.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Watatsumi call themselves the people of the sea and worship the Great Serpent as the Orobashi no
Mikoto. On Watatsumi Island, the shrine is the seat of government, and there are no commissioners appointed by the
Shogunate. All business, great and small, is conducted by the shrine maidens. The head shrine maiden, or Divine
Priestess, is the head of government and ceremonial affairs.</p>
<p>During the Archon War, Her Excellency the Almighty Raiden Ogosho brought all of Inazuma under Her unified rule. The
masses bowed down in fear and awe and each was content with their lot, else they were annihilated. No longer did any
covet that to which they were not entitled. The Great Serpent, Orobashi no Mikoto, had always remained in the western
region and respected the boundary between itself and the Narukami, and the two had lived in peace. But now, it suddenly
transgressed the boundary and invaded the east without warning.</p>
<p>The war was brutal, and brought great suffering to the people. The two sides fought bitterly on what is now known as
Yashiori Island, with many casualties and injuries on both sides. Her Excellency's cherished tengu general, Sasayuri,
was among those who lost their lives. Finally, the Great Serpent was slain by the Ogosho where its remains now lie on
Yashiori Island.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Sangonomiya sent envoys to announce surrender, and they have recognized the Inazuma Shogunate as the
legitimate and supreme ruler ever since.</p>

<p>Such is life. Mom and Dad always tell me to know right from wrong, but the reality is we are always choosing the lesser
of two evils. My girlfriend has decided to break up with me. Not only that, but she also got me fired by telling my
supervisor that I have a gambling addiction. Funny how I actually don't have much money to burn because I have
protection fees to pay. Failure to do so and anything could happen to my parents. My parents, however, think I am a
loser who could neither find a serious job nor save up any Mora. That's rather ironic, considering who I am doing this
for... How is it my fault? If it is, I blame myself for my incompetence to find a way out after all the struggles and
also my lack of courage to end it once and for all. Forget it. Just hand them the money when they arrive. After that I
really need to think about how to earn some Mora, or I'll only have seagrass on the dinner table in the future. OK, time
to choose between the worse and the worst. A falling blade, or a flying stone — which one is less painful? &quot;Bzzzzz—&quot;
I've been hearing strange noises. What's going on... Is the thunder going to strike? ... I wake up not knowing how long
I've been unconscious. All I remember is the sharp pain shooting through my body before I passed out. &quot;It doesn't feel
very painful... What!?&quot; I scream upon hearing the voice. Is this my voice? &quot;Ah, ah—&quot; So I'm not dreaming. I lift my arm
and see pale, soft skin covered in exquisite fabric. This is definitely not my body, but to arrive at this conclusion
requires a bold logical leap that my brain isn't yet ready to take. Because it simply doesn't make any sense. I try to
stand up to have a better view of my clothes. Every detail is brimming with luxury. The clothes are befitting of the one
holding the highest authority. Could it be... &quot;Where is that brat... Huh? This is... the Raiden Shogun!?&quot; The very title
itself bears weight. Ah, yes. I got reincarnated as the Raiden Shogun. The Kairagi who came to collect debts have
already stood in a formation. Although I cannot see their faces, their gestures convey their level of alertness and also
fear. I've never seen them like this. &quot;Come on! I—It's time to take revenge...&quot; He trails off — he's scared. Unwilling
to act like a coward in front of his underlings, the man can't just run, but he is also aware of the consequences. More
people are gathering, ten, twenty, fifty... Perhaps they think their numbers could make a difference. But the mortals'
idea of &quot;outnumbering&quot; simply does not apply to the Raiden Shogun, the wielder of divine powers. &quot;Let me try my blade
with you.&quot; I take a deep breath, focus my mind, and adopt the fighting stance. My destiny shall be rewritten, after my
blade unleashes this slash. &quot;Musou...&quot; ... Wait a moment. How do I unleash Musou no Hitotachi?</p>

<p>Mysteries creation conceals, the sun and moon omens reveal.</p>
<p>Three corners in darkness shrouded, the void by five saints clouded.</p>
<p>&quot;The universe has no beginning and no end, and so it was with the land that once was. But this matters not to us, for
the land that bears us no longer has anything to do with that eternity without start or ceasing.&quot;</p>
<p>— So said the lone sage, Aberaku, to the first Sunchild. The Sunchild had long intended to punish Aberaku. Summoning the
sage before the throne in this manner was but an additional way of making things difficult for him before detaining him.</p>
<p>Legend has it that Aberaku was opened up to wisdom by Tokoyo Ookami, and was thus able to bring light to Enkanomiya,
which had till then never seen the sun. But the Sunchild grew jealous of his talents, thus imprisoning him for life.
Yet these children of the sun never considered that had Aberaku not created that underground star, they never would
have existed in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;The origin of heaven and earth is like the chicken and egg, and are not dragons and snakes kin?&quot; No sooner had the sage
Aberaku uttered these words than he was overthrown by troops lying in ambush.</p>
<p>At that time, Enkanomiya had only just been bought some room to breathe by the appearance of the sun. The Dragonheirs
loved the dark and shunned the light, and thus could no longer act with impunity. The days when the Dragonheirs would
rampage and graze upon humanity like so much grass had, at last, come to an end, for the people of Enkanomiya finally
had the means to resist.</p>
<p>Yet it came to pass that the flaws in human nature would rear their ugly heads even before such outside threats could be
quelled. The people chose a Sunchild, crowned him king, and worshiped him, and yet he ruled with a brutal hand, framing
the righteous.</p>
<p>Unnumbered years would pass before a young child of Enkanomiya would make a wager with his peers. Alone, he would dive
beyond the three corners, evading the trail of the Dragonheirs, in search of a Dragonbone Flower. But what he found
instead within a great cavern was a mighty serpent, one he had never seen before. Somehow, as he gazed upon the
serpent's titanic form, the child felt no fear, but instead a kind of kinship.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the Profane Serpent. Though my servants are numberless, not one mortal now dwells in my shadow. That I have fallen
into this realm, and that we should meet... Perhaps this is fate. You are not one of my people, but you are human
nonetheless. Speak your desire, and I shall hear it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could you then, perchance, become our god?&quot;</p>
<p>Thus did they, human and serpent, go forth to face the royal authority of the Sunchild and the incursions of the
Dragonheirs beyond — thus was the curtain raised on the turning of the tide.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-before-sun-and-moon"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-before-sun-and-moon">Volume 2: Before Sun and Moon</a></h2>
<p>What we wish to record is the tale of how heaven's will took shape on the earth below. O heavenly gods, these creations
are your works. Grant us divine wisdom — let us endlessly record!</p>
<p><strong>&quot;When the Doves Held Branches&quot;</strong></p>
<p>When the eternal throne of the heavens came, the world was made anew. Then the true lord, the Primordial One, came forth
and did battle against the seven terrifying sovereigns, dragon-lords of the old world. The Primordial One created
shining shades of itself, and the number of these shades was four.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;On Phanes, or The Primordial One&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The Primordial One may have been Phanes. It had wings and a crown, and was birthed from an egg, androgynous in nature.
But for the world to be created, the egg's shell had to be broken. However, Phanes, the Primordial One, used the
eggshell to separate the &quot;universe&quot; and the &quot;microcosm of the world.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Forty Years After the Held Branches&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Forty winters entombed the flames, and forty summers churned the seas. The Seven Sovereigns were vanquished, and the
seven nations submitted to the heavens. The Primordial One, the great sovereign, began the creation of heaven and earth
for &quot;our&quot; sake — that of its creations which it cherished most, who would soon appear upon this earth.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Four Hundred Years After the Held Branches&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The mountains and rivers were made, and the seas and oceans accepted those who rebelled and those who would not kneel.
The Primordial One and one of its shades created the birds of the air, the beasts of the earth, and the fish of the sea.
Together, they also created flowers, grass, and trees, before finally creating humans — our ancestors, numerous as the
stars in the sky, uncountable as the sand on the shore. From that time, our ancestors made a covenant with the
Primordial One, and so entered into a new age.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Year of the Ark's Opening&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The Primordial One had a sacred plan for humans. As long as they were happy, it too rejoiced.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Year After the Ark's Opening&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The people worked the land, and so came the first harvest. The people mined, and so reaped the first crop of precious
ore. The people gathered, and the first poems were written.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Year of Jubilee&quot;</strong></p>
<p>If there was hunger, the heavens would bring down food and rain. If there was poverty, the earth would bring forth its
riches. If melancholy were to spread, the heavens would reply with their voices. The one taboo was to succumb to
temptation. But the path to temptation had already been sealed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Funerary Year&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The second throne of the heavens came, and war was rekindled, as it was in the world's creation. That day, the heavens
collapsed and the earth was rent asunder. Our ancestors and their ancestral land fell into this place during that
conflict. The era of darkness had begun.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The First Year of Darkness&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The people of the Seven Sovereigns had found refuge in the oceans, and the Dragonheirs of the Depths ruled this
particular place, which led to war between them and our ancestors. Our ancestors chased them into the shadows with the
light of a thousand lanterns, and they hid in those shadows, hunting us. But there was only darkness in this place, and
so their hunting grounds were untrammeled. The prayers of the people turned into lamentations, but the Primordial One
and its three other shining shades could not hear.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Parable of the Sun&quot;</strong></p>
<p>In a dark cavern, there lived a group of people who had never seen the light. Among them was a sage who had once seen
the sun, and he told the gathered folk about what life under the sun was like, and about the great might of the sun.
Seeing that they did not comprehend, he lit a torch — and thus did people come to worship the flame, believing it to be
the sun. They even got used to a life of darkness and fire. When the sage died, someone would monopolize the flame.
Using it, they would cast a long shadow over the land.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Parable of the Lethied Lotus&quot;</strong></p>
<p>A lotus that causes all who look upon it to forget their troubles. A ship captain searching for the way back to the
surface discovered a tribe of people who ate these lotuses. Some crew members stayed in that place. Others rejected that
temptation. Life is a boundless ocean of suffering. We are only searching for the way home.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Third Year of Darkness&quot;</strong></p>
<p>We knew the only one who had not forsaken us as the &quot;Ruler of Time.&quot; She was the moment. She was every moment. She was
the measure of a thousand winds and the sun and the moon. She was every second of joy, every moment of rage, every
instant of longing, every minute of obsession. She was every flash of delirium. We call her Kairos, or &quot;the ruler of the
unchanging world.&quot; We dare not speak her true, secret name, and so I pen it here, only once, and in reverse: &quot;Htoratsi.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Year of Blindness&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The sage Abrax's wisdom was awakened, and he unveiled a light-bringing miracle from within his hands. So our ancestors
began to build the Helios, with him as their leader.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Year of Sight, or the First Year of Sun and Moon&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Helios, the divine chariot of the sun, was finally completed. The Whitenight came, and Evernight was banished.
The years of the Sun and Moon had begun.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Second Year of Sun and Moon&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Our ancestors sought the returning way, for surely the war on the surface had ended by then.
But the Primordial One, the first throne, had laid down a ban, preventing our ancestors from finding the path home.
In that case, the Primordial One must have defeated the Second Who Came.
Abrax was imprisoned by order of the Sunchild.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Parable of the Tree&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The king's gardener and the tree spirit of the royal garden were in love. But the king wished to repair the beams of his
pavilion, and so needed to cut down the tree with the most spiritual energy within it. The king was the incarnation of
the Primordial One, and the gardener could not defy the sovereign of sovereigns, and so he could only bring his plea to
the king's priest, who was the incarnation of Tokoyo Ookami. The priest had pity on the gardener and said to him: &quot;Go,
and cut the branches of the spirit-tree down.&quot; The gardener did so, and afterward did as the king ordered, cutting the
spirit-tree itself down. Then the priest said: &quot;Plant the spirit-tree's branches in the ground.&quot; But the gardener said:
&quot;A spirit-tree shall take five hundred years to grow.&quot; The priest said: &quot;Your one thought shall echo through eternity.&quot;
And so the gardener planted the branches in his back yard. In an instant, the slim branches grow into a new tree, and
the new tree spirit was a continuation of the past one. For it is the God of Moments who is able to take &quot;seeds&quot; from
this &quot;moment&quot; into the past and the future.</p>
<p><strong>The Tenth Year of Sun and Moon</strong></p>
<p>Abrax is long gone. The events before the sun and the moon have been recorded sufficiently. Well, if I did not dare to
write things down just as they happened, how could I consider myself a scribe of Tokoyo Ookami? Hark, I hear armor
without. Here, I shall stop writing.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-hydrological-studies-in-byakuyakoku"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-hydrological-studies-in-byakuyakoku">Volume 3: Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku</a></h2>
<p>The lands beneath the aphotic depths are vastly different from those on the surface, to the extent that all
surface-derived common sense must be abandoned down below. All we formerly knew of land and sea was given unto us
directly by the heavens. In this new world of ours, we must begin groping even for the simplest methodologies anew. O
you who come after and read these words, do not take the life you lead for normalcy. Even if after a hundred or a
thousand years, people should grow used to life down here, always remember — these days with neither sun nor moon are
abnormal. Even if some sage were to draw us the sun, there will surely be filthy wretches who will borrow its light to
cast long shadows over us. This book is intended to help people understand the world they live in, and to never forget
our desire to return to the light.</p>
<p>(This book has been constantly edited, redacted, and modified over the years. Even
the name of the book's title has seen change from &quot;Aphotic Earth&quot; to &quot;Tokoyokoku,&quot; before becoming &quot;Byakuyakoku.&quot; Later,
due to the grace of Watatsumi, the people of the depths would return to the sea's surface. But it seems like &quot;Aphotic
Earth&quot; has some special meaning, and it has not been universally changed throughout the text.)</p>
<p><strong>Of Wind and Water</strong></p>
<p>Byakuyakoku has no mountains to speak of, and so it is pointless to speak of them. However, our priests and sages have
detected something. Even in these depths, the power of the &quot;undying wind&quot; and the &quot;water&quot; still remain. The
personification of the &quot;undying wind&quot; is known as &quot;Tokoyo Ookami,&quot; and is poetically rendered &quot;the thousand winds&quot; or
&quot;the thousand winds of time.&quot; &quot;Water,&quot; on the other hand, is the might of the Vishap Realm, represented by the Bathysmal
Vishaps. We have already developed a certain field of study regarding the relationship between Sunfire, wind, and water.
As such, both hydrology and the undying wind must be considered before undertaking any project of civil engineering.</p>
<p><strong>The Borders of Byakuyakoku</strong></p>
<p>The borders of Byakuyakoku are marked out by three corners. These mark the limits of the see-saw clash between humanity
and the vishaps. During the era of Byakuyakoku, Towers of the Three Realms were built at these three corners, used to
harmonize the three realms. Their ancient names have been lost to time, and they were renamed after the coming of
Watatsumi. These towers are exceedingly important, and they are not in locations aligned with either wind or water.
Rather, their purpose is to stabilize the tendencies of Byakuyakoku and control its winds and waters. If these towers
were to be imperiled, so would the entire nation. As such, they have been hidden using secret arts. Only the shrine
maidens and the Vassals of Watatsumi can summon them forth.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrows</strong></p>
<p>The Narrows were, in the earliest times, sandwiched between the mountain face and an area known as the Roundlands, thus
earning that location its name. However, the exceedingly strange tectonic shifts in Byakuyakoku caused the Roundlands to
collapse into the depths, thus causing The Narrows to widen significantly.</p>
<p><strong>The Serpent's Heart</strong></p>
<p>From the first time our ancestors discovered this place, it had already played host to a unique phenomenon in which
space itself might overlap in a certain locale. Later, those who came before us would utilize this phenomenon by
creating the Serpent's Heart. It would be used to guard secrets, imprison criminals, and worship the great imaginary
serpent, Ouroboros. In the earliest times, this place was called Delphi, the land of snakes. This name did not change
even after the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami. Ancient art depicts the scaleless serpent as &quot;Ouroboros,&quot; and the
coral-adorned serpent as &quot;Orobashi.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Dainichi Mikoshi</strong></p>
<p>The earliest name of this place was &quot;Helios,&quot; and it was the high tower built by the sage Aberaku, standing for earth,
the element between wind and water. According to prophecy, this was likely the sun that the sage displayed, used to
light those lightless caverns. And just as those prophecies suggested, it was also later used to cast a great shadow
over the nation.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-bathysmal-vishap-experimental-records"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-bathysmal-vishap-experimental-records">Volume 4: Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records</a></h2>
<p>...Effective today, all experiments regarding the Dragonheirs will be directed by Watatsumi Omikami in person. All files
preceding the founding year of the Watatsumi calendar have been destroyed. Dossier serial numbers shall no longer use
the categories Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon, which used the ancient Watatsumi tongue. Instead, we shall use
Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Ether, and Void going forward. All quotes and notations are to be written within
quotation marks (&quot;&quot;). The following order of writing should be observed: File Header-Serial Number-Subject-Author.
Author can be omitted, or their internal title within the research lab may be used. Usage of a researcher's ancient
Byakuyakoku/Enkanomiya name or modern Watatsumi/Narukami/Inazuman name is forbidden. These experimental records are not
to be used for the writing of diaries, love letters, or fantasy novels.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Dragonheirs' (hereafter named Bathysmal Vishaps or simply vishaps) evolution is plain for all to see.
(&quot;Water-101-Dragonheir Evolution: I&quot;) We have tried lowering the temperature in the living environs of a young
heat-resistant vishap. As a result, they were weaker once matured. We suspect that this is because its body did not
possess the &quot;seed&quot; required to resist such an environment. However, its descendants would all possess high body fat,
greater predilection towards sleep, and would express the Cryo element. (Please refer to the experimental data after the
main text. The abnormal data derived from Sample 3 is due to my assistant feeling sorry for the subject of the
anti-hunger control group and feeding it surreptitiously.) When we then placed their descendants into sweltering
conditions, they would again choose, like their ancestors, the heat resistance trait. However, none of them have
developed traits indicative of the Pyro element thus far. We do not have enough data to reach a conclusion at present,
but we can make an educated guess that Bathysmal Vishaps have the ability to awaken their &quot;seed&quot; freely before
maturation. Vishap mothers can also create new &quot;seeds&quot; to pass on to their descendants should they encounter heretofore
unseen, challenging environments. It can be said that even before encountering us, the people of Enkanomiya, the
Bathysmal Vishaps had already stored a veritable armory within their bodies.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The results of the intelligence tests are astonishing. (&quot;Void-207-Vishap Intelligence Research&quot;). Through a screening
process consisting of rewards and punishments (although previous research indicates that screening is unnecessary —
vishaps are, one and all, adapters par excellence), the linguistic capacities of vishaps four generations down are
starting to approach that of a 12-year-old human student. Perhaps it might be more accurate to say that vishaps always
had their own methods of communication, and what they are displaying here is their ability to learn. We believe that
these experiments should be stopped. If not, we may yet be proven narrow-minded for having dismissed that last person
who wrote a fantastical tale about vishap-people. Prophecy holds that the Dragon Sovereign of Water will be born in a
human form. We must not let this thing happen in Enkanomiya.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>All previous attempts at grafting have failed. (&quot;Void-907-Watatsumi Omikami's Special Orders: I&quot;). Because they cannot
accept Watatsumi Omikami's blood, the vishaps will fall victim to various adverse effects. Perhaps they are not yet
strong enough, but we cannot be sure — indeed, according to our rationalized vishap evolutionary roadmap, we should have
already bred the strongest vishap possible.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The grafting can be considered a success. (&quot;Void-907-Watatsumi Omikami's Special Orders: III&quot;). The rejection originates
from the vishaps having been beings of the Light Realm (also known as elemental creatures), and thus being at odds with
the Human Realm, of which Omikami and its coral vassals are a part.</p>
<p>All experimental logs are closed. No experiment conducted here resulted in the death of any Dragonheirs — they all lived
to see the end of their days. Praise be to Watatsumi Omikami, gracious and beneficent.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-in-the-light-beneath-the-shadow"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-in-the-light-beneath-the-shadow">Volume 5: In the Light, Beneath the Shadow</a></h2>
<p>Question 1: What walks on four feet in the early morning, two feet during the day, and three feet at night?</p>
<p>Answer: A vishap who transforms into a person to attend a ball, then breaks one of its legs and eventually ends up
walking with a cane.</p>
<p>Sages like this answer the most, and it is the children get it right almost exclusively. For adults, it always smells
like a horrible conspiracy when a vishap turns into a human. According to a prophecy of old, the Dragon of Water, the
ancient lord of vishaps, will definitely descend in the form of a human. However, for children, the answer to the
question indicates the possibility of mutual understanding. But it is not a good idea to make vishaps sound adorable.
Though such jokes defang the fear, they also lower the guard of the children. (Dragonheirs of the Depths have evolved to
wield the power of other elements and have hence lost their purity. As such, the Dragon of Water will no longer be born
from among their ranks.)</p>
<p>Question 2: With only one mouth, this being sometimes has four feet, sometimes, two feet, and sometimes, three feet.
Though unable to morph into other things, it is able to walk on the earth, swim in the water, and fly in the sky. The
more feet it walks on, the feebler it grows. What is this being?</p>
<p>Answer: A human.</p>
<p>Humans crawl on hands and feet as babies, walk on two legs as adults, and use a cane as elders.
The answer is undoubtedly &quot;a human.&quot;</p>
<p>Question 3: What talks with only one mouth but walks on four and two feet?</p>
<p>Answer: Someone raising livestock.</p>
<p>This riddle is a very ancient one. In the past, we could only understand the meaning of livestock from reading texts.
&quot;Four legs&quot; refers to four-legged animals like the Aux, Hors, and Foreste Bore. After Byakuyakoku fell into the ocean
depths, these animals died out within two generations due to a lack of habitable land and food. Since the arrival of
Watatsumi Omikami, some of us have returned to the sea's surface to build a home and interact with the people there.
Therefore, we have been able to review the names of these animals. According to the Vassal and the Omikami's prophecy,
we shall all move back to the sea's surface someday, so it is important to get these names right. Aux means cattle, Hors
means horse, and Foreste Bore means forest boar.</p>
<p>Question 4: Who are the two sisters who give birth to each other every day?</p>
<p>Answer: Day and night, or Whitenight and Evernight.</p>
<p>This riddle is easy to understand. It alludes to the succession of day and night, which in Byakuyakoku means the
cyclical Whitenight and Evernight under the control of the Dainichi Mikoshi. Though the land was in everlasting night
before the Dainichi Mikoshi was built, the light of day that people had seen has remained unchanged. By the way, the two
special astronomical phenomena of Byakuyakoku — the mirages and the Sinshades — were at first indiscriminately referred
to as Eidolons and seen as the two sides of the same coin. It was not until the arrival of Watatsumi Omikami that the
people of Byakuyakoku were able to understand the two phenomena and name them differently. Though the sun did not shine
upon Byakuyakoku, the mirages that appeared in Whitenights were named Sunfire Phantasms and those of Evernight,
Ghostfire Phantasms. As time went by, both of them came to be referred to as Sunfire Phantasms, for they are essentially
the same thing.</p>
<p>Question 5: I am the Shadowborn of the Lord of Light. I am a wingless bird that rises from the earth to the sky. Those
who shed tears in my presence feel no sorrow in their bosoms. Away with a gentle breeze I fade, and thus ends my
fleeting life.</p>
<p>Answer: The answer is smoke. Birds are winged creatures, and it is normal that they are not seen in Enkanomiya.</p>
<p>Question 6: A father has twelve children, each then giving birth to sixty daughters of different appearances. Of them,
thirty are pale and thirty are dark. The whole family, knowing not death, will only fade away. Who is the father?</p>
<p>Answer: The answer is the year. The people of Byakuyakoku may find the part about sixty pale or dark granddaughters a
bit confusing. But everything will start to make sense once they crack Question 4.</p>
<p>There used to be a sequel to this riddle in ancient times. It roughly said that every granddaughter would give birth to
twelve descendants, and each of them would then have sixty children. Every such child later would give birth to another
sixty, who would go on to have children of their own. This would continue until at last, all the offspring would
together give birth to the one and only primordial child — Tokoyo Ookami, the &quot;mother&quot; of fourteen billion years.</p>
<p>Watatsumi Omikami forbade people from spreading this riddle.</p>

<p>The shrine maiden Mouun was born to the Yuna Clan. This clan was one of the great houses that first followed their
Omikami out into the sunlight, and is still known today for their traditional talent in whalesongs and their closeness
with all marine life. Mouun entered Sangonomiya Shrine at a young age and would learn the etiquette and ritual arts of
the Watatsumi shrine maidens, history, governance, and the island folk-tunes. Her younger twin sister Ayame, who in
later days would be known as &quot;Umigozen,&quot; was a female diver, making a living through collecting pearls. By the time news
that the Shogunate had unified all the Inazuman islands reached Watatsumi, Mouun and Ayame were already quite famous
among the island's people. In the folk-tunes that still persist till today, Mouun was a wise and gentle soul who helped
to steer the people away from meaningless conflict, while Ayame was valiant and cheerful, her power sufficient to
wrestle against fierce sea creatures.</p>
<p>When Watatsumi Omikami ceased in his hesitation and embarked on that hopeless eastern expedition, Sangonomiya's first
navy was entrusted by the then-Divine Priestess to Mouun and her sister. This was also the beginning of Mouun's
association with the giant whale named &quot;Daikengyou.&quot;</p>
<p>Legend has it that Daikengyou was a huge blind whale that had lived for five hundred years and four hundred years before
that. The dark depths of the ocean floor were its home, and the fishes of the deep and the moonglow-beauteous jellyfish
were its faithful servants. Five hundred narwhals guarded its left flank and five hundred humpback whales played music
to its right. Some folk-tunes claim that it could have swallowed ten coral islands in one gulp before spitting out five
skerries in its deep, satiated slumber.</p>
<p>Even amongst those of the Watatsumi people who were skilled in whalesong, none had faced this titan and returned whole
to tell the tale. But at the Divine Priestess' direction, Mouun dived deep into the whale's phosphorescent palace just
as the moon rose high enough to pierce the ocean mists. None knew how Mouun persuaded Daikengyou to join her. But on the
third moonrise after her departure, when the waves drew back from the shore, the people witnessed Daikengyou surface
from the tranquil ocean, shimmering with silver light as it bore Mouun on its back.</p>
<p>Later, Daikengyou and its marine courtiers would follow Mouun and her sister into battle at Omikami's side, though the
battle ultimately and inexorably went ill... Mouun made to retreat when she heard that Omikami and Touzannou had been
slain together, but she was ambushed by the tengu Sasayuri's subordinates en route and was herself slain together with
Daikengyou the mighty whale, their remains captured by the Shogunate. As for her sister, &quot;Umigozen&quot; Ayame, she
disappeared into the blood-red ocean after a valiant stand, never to be seen again.</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-19"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-19">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p><strong>Foreword</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to a fruitful new writer recruitment drive and the phenomenal success of the contest &quot;This Novel is Amazing!&quot; we
have received many highly original works from up-and-coming writers all over the world. We would like to take this
opportunity to thank our international writers for supporting Inazuma's light novel industry, and we'd also like to
thank Kanjou Commissioner Hiiragi Shinsuke for his grace and generosity. It is thanks to all of you that we are able to
bring so many outstanding works to the readers of Inazuma here today.</p>
<p>As you all know, prior to the promulgation of the Sakoku Decree, a number of accomplished samurai from various lands
were active in Inazuma. One of them, whose name is Hamavaran, hails from the distant rainforest nation of Sumeru, but
came all the way to the land of the lightning's glow to be an agent of chivalry. Though tales of Hamavaran's deeds were
once buried during the peak of unchanging eternity under Her Excellency the Shogun, they have now been given life anew
thanks to the narrative prowess of a good friend of mine, the budding author, Pursina.</p>
<p>Now, without further ado, please enjoy &quot;The Saga of Hamavaran&quot; at your leisure.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-17"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-17">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>&quot;It's not the tempest at sea I'm worried about, it's the prospect of deferred graduation...&quot;
This was the thought occupying Hamavaran's mind on his long voyage to Inazuma...</p>
<p>&quot;You're worrying about not getting your thesis finished in time and having to delay your graduation, aren't you?&quot;</p>
<p>The familiar-sounding voice came from outside the cabin.</p>
<p>&quot;Shush... Who are you, anyway!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who, me? Is that important?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good point. No, you're not that important...&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey...&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And so, as the great thunderstorm raged, shaking the seas and heavens alike, Hamavaran began arguing with the quiet
voice from outside the window, while all worries about the storm and fears about not completing the thesis on time paled
into insignificance.</p>
<p>But strangely, when Hamavaran arrived on shore, the owner of the voice that had been arguing back from outside the
window was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it was the ghost of a shipwreck victim...&quot;
Hamavaran considered this possibility.</p>
<p>Ghosts are just the Ley Lines' memories of the deceased, Hamavaran reasoned. It's a completely natural phenomenon that
occurs due to resonance between past and present. To be sure, it's highly unusual for this to happen in the middle of
the ocean, but it's by no means impossible.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you calling a ghost? You're the ghost!&quot;</p>
<p>Hamavaran had finally produced a satisfactory hypothesis to explain
away the symptoms of delirium and had moved onto luggage-collection when the familiar voice piped up once more.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-14"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-14">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>... &quot;So, you really are a ghost?&quot; &quot;No! I'm not even dead yet!&quot; &quot;But you've never been alive either?&quot; &quot;Um... Yeah, I
guess you could say that...&quot; The talkative young girl, who claimed to be a shikigami, gulped down glutinous-rice dango
with such speed and intensity that Hamavaran began to worry she might choke.</p>
<p>&quot;If I had to explain it, I'd say my situation is more like that of a 'ghost-calling.'&quot; &quot;So like I said, a ghost...&quot;
&quot;Noooo, not that kind of ghost!&quot; One argument later, Hamavaran finally understood that what she called &quot;ghost-calling&quot;
was something roughly equivalent to what in Sumeru is known as &quot;spirit-warding.&quot; Both involve signing a pact using one's
real name. The notion that you can command someone when you know their real name is common to many of the world's mystic
traditions, and it highlights a core fear held by humans: the fear of being under someone else's control.</p>
<p>With thoughts thusly wandering, Hamavaran once again began to regret specializing in the much-neglected discipline of
marine biology instead of mysticism... First I have to sail all the way to Inazuma, then I have to go through the living
hell that is a thesis defense... But maybe running into this noisy little thing is a stroke of good luck for me...</p>

<p>Mysteries creation conceals, the sun and moon omens reveal. Three corners in darkness shrouded, the void by five saints
clouded.</p>
<p>&quot;The universe has no beginning and no end, and so it was with the land that once was. But this matters not to us, for
the land that bears us no longer has anything to do with that eternity without start or ceasing.&quot; —So said the lone
sage, Aberaku, to the first Sunchild. The Sunchild had long intended to punish Aberaku. Summoning the sage before the
throne in this manner was but an additional way of making things difficult for him before detaining him. Legend has it
that Aberaku was opened up to wisdom by the Tokoyo Ookami, and was thus able to bring light to Enkanomiya, which had
till then never seen the sun. But the Sunchild grew jealous of his talents, thus imprisoning him for life. Yet these
children of the sun never considered that had Aberaku not created that underground star, they never would have existed
in the first place. &quot;The origin of heaven and earth is like the chicken and egg, and are not dragons and snakes kin?&quot; No
sooner had the sage Aberaku uttered these words than he was overthrown by troops lying in ambush.</p>
<p>At that time, Enkanomiya had only just been brought some room to breathe by the appearance of the sun. The Dragonheirs
loved the dark and shunned the light, and thus could no longer act with impunity. The days when the Dragonheirs would
rampage and graze on humanity like so much grass had, at last, come to an end, for the people of Enkanomiya finally had
the means to resist. Yet it came to pass that the flaws in human nature would rear their ugly heads even before such
outside threats could be quelled. The people chose a Sunchild, crowned him king, and worshiped him, and yet he ruled
with a brutal hand, framing the righteous.</p>
<p>Unnumbered years would pass before a young child of Enkanomiya would make a wager with his peers. Alone, he would dive
beyond the three corners, evading the trail of the Dragonheir, in search of a Dragonbone Flower. But what he found
instead within a great cavern was a mighty serpent, one he had never seen before. Somehow, as he gazed upon the
serpent's titanic form, the child felt no fear, but instead a kind of kinship. &quot;I am the Profane Serpent. Though my
servants are numberless, not one mortal now dwells in my shadow. That I have fallen into this realm, and that we would
meet... Perhaps this is fate. You are not one of my people, but you are human nonetheless. Speak your desire, and I
shall hear it.&quot; &quot;Could you then, perchance, become our god?&quot;</p>
<p>Thus did they, human and serpent, go forth to face the royal authority of the Sunchild and the incursions of the
Dragonheirs beyond — thus was the curtain raised on the turning of the tide.</p>

<p><strong>The Tanuki's Oral History of Inazuma</strong></p>
<p>They say that in the past, before the fragile and short-lived mortals had crossed over the sea to these lands, Inazuma
was once a land that belonged to the tanuki. Lazy and fickle by nature, the tanuki never worried about tomorrow, nor did
they carry today's troubles with them through the night. During that period, the land of Inazuma was a cozy paradise for
the tanuki and every day was a fun-filled festival.</p>
<p>At least, that's what the tanuki elders say.</p>
<p>Later on, the kitsune arrived by sea, forcing the tanuki into a great war that lasted first for 800 years and then for
another 800 years, with both sides suffering heavy casualties, until eventually the only option was to hold peace talks.
The tanuki are a stubborn bunch and to this day still don't admit defeat, but the fact remains that they ceded the giant
Thunder Sakura to the kitsune.</p>
<p>But the kitsune are a crafty and cunning bunch too, and equally skilled in the art of shape-shifting. It is said that in
that great war, as a consequence of the constant switcheroo trickery, many poor souls became completely disoriented and
could not for the life of them keep track of who was who — eventually forgetting even who they were, what they were, and
which side they were supposed to be on.</p>
<p>Thus were the hapless mortals born. The product of bewildered youkai.</p>
<p>This tale and many others were told to me by the tengu who likes to boast.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-yoichis-tale"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-yoichis-tale">Volume 2: Yoichi's Tale</a></h2>
<p>The tengu's name is Yoichi, and she lives in Hanamizaka on a small side street called Toki Alley. She rents a shop there
that sells alcohol, and lives a leisurely existence.</p>
<p>I say &quot;leisurely.&quot; That's putting it nicely. &quot;Completely and utterly chaotic&quot; would be a more accurate description.</p>
<p>In theory, someone who enjoys alcohol enough to start a business selling it should know a thing or two about it. This
applies as much to youkai as to humans. But to be absolutely blunt, Yoichi has terrible taste in alcohol and has no
business sense at all. Worst of all, in all her days in the human realm, she has never ridden herself of her awful tengu
habits. Sometimes she will get drunk and stir up trouble among other youkai or kidnap human children and parade around
all night at the festival, causing total chaos. Other times, she will barge into a theater, with no regard for the
atmosphere, then casually strut on stage and start beating up the lead actor... the list goes on. If it weren't for her
senior status among the youkai and her extensive connections in human society, I suspect Yoichi might have been dealt
with by some hero or other at the foot of a mountain long ago. But the youkai and human folk of Toki Alley see her quite
differently. Even the Great Gongen has never given her serious punishment, because she has never caused any major
trouble.</p>
<p>Though haughty and slovenly by nature, as a &quot;great youkai, set apart from the common folk&quot; (her own words), Yoichi isn't
greatly attached to worldly possessions. Any money she comes into is spent swiftly on alcohol — or else on novels from
Yae Publishing House, which she skims through halfway before promptly defenestrating them. As a result, her home is not
what you would call &quot;domesticated&quot; — quite the opposite, in fact.</p>
<p>Simply put, she doesn't have any worldly possessions of sentimental value... the sole exception being the golden paper
fan she wears on her waist.</p>
<p>The Great Tengu are a race of youkai that travels to many different worlds, and it's not at all uncommon for them to
adorn themselves with battle trophies that have an interesting backstory. Such is the case for this paper fan. On a
moonlit night, a drunken Yoichi, her shirt collar wide open, began bragging to me about its story...</p>
<p>She said that in one of the many worlds she had traversed, she took the form of a haughty young male archer, serving
under an equally haughty shogun. Under that shogun's command, she, — or rather, &quot;he&quot; — had proudly shot down countless
opponents, including big-bellied mortal samurai and crafty tanuki ninjas. Even the jikininki, despite their bulky
figures, were no match against a single shot from Yoichi's bow.</p>
<p>&quot;Hahahahaha! You are truly a great soldier! Your vision is keen like lightning, just like the Great Tengu!&quot; At that age,
the conceited shogun tended to laugh in a loud and obnoxious manner, which was most unseemly. After that, Yoichi made
numerous contributions for the shogun, executing many monsters and unfortunate mortals. It goes without saying that she
probably made some of the stories up. But what she truly became renowned for was the final battle of that world, a world
in which she spent a hundred years.</p>
<p>In that naval battle, the shogun and rebels braved storms to wage bloody warfare between the straits. The monsters
numbered at least eight million, maybe eight million more than that, while the mortal samurai must have numbered in the
tens of millions. In terms of casualties, the headcount cannot be known, but what is known is that 800 thousand ships
sank in the course of the battle. Yoichi reached this staggering tally with my assistance as she was vomiting up a
bellyful of wine by the window.</p>
<p>As is typical of so many stories about bitterly fought wars stuck in stalemate, brave heroes from both sides mowed down
their enemies like blades of grass, painting the sea blood-red, while the rival generals stubbornly refused to back
down, preferring to stay locked in intransigence than to withdraw their troops and head home to get a good night's
sleep.</p>
<p>Finally, on one cold moonlit night, a small boat slowly floated out from enemy lines. A lone figure stood on the boat,
swaying like a reflection in the water. Beside the figure was a shimmering flagpole with a paper fan at the top. It gave
off a golden glow in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&quot;Argh, ARGH... I am furious, furious! This blatant provocation cannot be tolerated!&quot; The shogun squinted his eyes, saw
the golden fan in the distance, and instantly flew into a rage.</p>
<p>Yoichi couldn't understand why the shogun's self-esteem was so fragile, but was too lazy to empathize with the petty
mortal sense of dignity. At that moment, she... no, &quot;he,&quot; fixed his keen tengu gaze on the floating figure in the boat.</p>
<p>What he saw was a woman, and an altogether different one than Yoichi.</p>
<p>Moments later, a single arrow flew across the moon and tore apart the night sky.</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, great!&quot; Soon, the shogun's shouting was drowned out by the cheers of the army.</p>
<p>&quot;If those two old-timers find out what they have lost, they'd probably be so angry they'd rupture their spleens!&quot; Yoichi
let out a conceited and mischievous laugh. She was drunk. The Great Tengu had a certain twinkle in her eye, of the
rather repulsive variety, that she made no attempt to cover up.</p>
<p>What had happened was that as the arrow flew through the air, Yoichi had already spread out her giant wings and flown
across the strait, snatching the golden paper fan and the bewildered beauty holding onto it as she passed over the boat.
She then took the opportunity to push over the insufferably loud-mouthed shogun, and flew away from the battle. A
perfect tengu snatch and grab. It was just a shame that... &quot;Well, you know what happened, she was a neko. She scratched
me to pieces...&quot; Yoichi stuck out her tongue and sighed with exasperation.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh right, it's snapper season! You should take some back with you.&quot; &quot;Hmm? The stingy Great Tengu has a heart?&quot; &quot;I meant
for that woman!&quot; Seeing the threatening gaze from the greatly tipsy Great Tengu, I hastily gathered the remaining
snapper in my arms and left.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-osens-tale"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-osens-tale">Volume 3: Osen's Tale</a></h2>
<p>I left Yoichi's house and followed the winding alley for a while, then turned into a narrow street to arrive at that old
lady's home. When the night is pitch black and the moon has climbed its peak, the neko awaken from their slumber. It is
said that neko who have lived up for hundreds or even thousands of years can easily take on the form of a young woman,
tempting people into doing funny and foolish things or chasing innocent travelers out of some sense of spiteful
vengeance. But that's just the stuff of mortal imagination. In fact, the bake-neko only take on the form of young women
when they're especially angry. Most of the time, the prefer to take on the form of an older woman, partly because it
matches their crafty and cantankerous nature, but also because they can use old age as a disguise, portraying themselves
as gentle souls to poor unsuspecting passers-by.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, that's not free!&quot; At the sound of the voice, I raised my head to see a young woman sitting on the eaves, as if
she'd been there for a while. Her face was obscured by the shadows, and all I could make out was something resembling a
smile on her face and golden-green light reflected by her eyes. Moonlight flowed from her semi-exposed shoulders down
her dress, trickling through the gaps in the hem of her skirt and outlining her long slender legs with porcelain-white
luster. She has absent-mindedly playing with a kendama in her hand.</p>
<p>Yep, the old lady was definitely furious...</p>
<p>&quot;Tut-tut, you're late again tonight.&quot; &quot;Of course, s—sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>Mosquitoes kept bumping into the paper lamp, causing it to flicker lethargically in response. As the moon shone down, a
humid wind arose. Before long, it had brought the cicadas' cries to a stop.</p>
<p>With her hair flowing down, the lady turned the spinning wheel with a perverse smile on her face. It was quite
terrifying. Now, despite my being a tanuki on friendly-enough terms with the tengu to sit and drink with them, even I
have to be on my very best behavior around the bake-neko. So, I promptly prostrated myself and apologized profusely for
my transgression.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind, never mind. Since the snapper is still fresh, you can get up.&quot; With great difficulty on account of my
rotund tanuki form, I resumed a normal seated position. The young woman slowly transformed back into an old woman, who
had a kindly but strange smile on her face. &quot;Thank you, Auntie Sen.&quot; Call me Osen!</p>
<p>I was relived. But something still felt off.</p>
<p>&quot;Hahahaha, anyway, how's that fool doing these days?&quot; With a slurp, Osen swallowed one of the fish whole, including the
tail.</p>
<p>As for the story of how her fate became intertwined with that of the Great Tengu, the facts can only be described as
farcical. We have already heard the ridiculous tales from Yoichi's perspective, but the bake-neko tells a completely
different story.</p>
<p>Osen wasn't born in our world, but one where mortals were much more savage. One night, in a bamboo forest, the young
Osen was captured by a wandering monk. After passing through many hands, she was eventually sold to the shogun and
became some sort of &quot;Obake-neko.&quot; She has few memories of those days beyond wondering why the high-ranking officials of
the mortal world enjoyed annoying her and playing with her. Every day, she was driven to scratch her enemies to pieces,
or forced to play boring games which only they seemed to enjoy. This went on for such a long time that any normal person
would have been driven to madness. But youkai live such long lives that they have far more patience than mortals.</p>
<p>Later, when her shogun and the rebels' shogun started fighting, Osen transformed into a ninja.</p>
<p>&quot;This is where the story gets even more boring...&quot; Osen squinted her eyes as she said this, letting out a huge yawn that
stretched from ear to ear.</p>
<p>On the night of that naval battle, the shogun thought of an ingenious scheme... The shogun ordered Osen to transform
into a beautiful young woman and stand on a small boat with a golden fan to humiliate the rebels so that they dare not
approach. Even if they did, the bake-neko would teach them a brutal lesson.</p>
<p>But of course, Yoichi was standing amidst the ranks of the rebels... &quot;But of course, that fool suddenly stood up and
starting ranting and raving about shooting down the fan with a single arrow.&quot; Then the Great Tengu... &quot;... Slipped and
fell, landing in the ocean with a great splash.&quot; The old woman's feline face failed to stifle a smile, and erupted into
jeering laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;She was so drunk that night that she though the seas were the stormiest she'd ever seen. In fact, the moon shone calmly
and coolly, and there was not a trace of wind.&quot; &quot;But it'd been a few hundred years since I'd seen someone so
entertaining. So, to save her the humiliation, I stifled my laughter and took the paper fan down myself... Then, a roar
of cheers came from their fleet. Just thinking about it amuses me to this day.&quot;</p>
<p>Next, the Great Tengu unfurled her giant wings and leaped into the air, like a cloud covering the moon, and swooped down
towards the beautiful woman... &quot;A flurry of arrows later, and she fell into the sea looking like a hedgehog. I couldn't
keep a straight face any longer and started laughing uncontrollably.&quot; Laughing raucously, Osen dragged the ill-fated
tengu from the sea, put her in a headlock, and flew over the fleets from both sides, laughing maniacally and causing
both generals to lose their tempers. People says she flew over eight ships in a row, then disappeared into the night.
The feline youkai's laughter could be heard for more than three days after the battle has finished.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't stop laughing, so I scratched her as hard as I could... But the sorry state she was in made me laugh even
harder, and the harder I scratched, the harder I laughed, hahahahaha...&quot; The neko transformed into an old lady and
laughed uncontrollably.</p>
<p>&quot;Afterwards, she brought me to this world and treated me like I was some kind of trophy!&quot; The old woman pursed her lips
as her face transformed into that of a sulky young woman. But this looked quite comical, because her cheeks were still
flushed bright red from having laughed so hard she could barely breathe. &quot;I am NOT a trophy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, now that I think about it, that's probably the whole reason why she doesn't dare to visit me herself.&quot; The elderly
female with feline features and the face of a young woman sighed gently, then smiled a cunning smile once more.</p>
<p>&quot;You should go. Leave the door open, and come back on the the next full moon.&quot; &quot;Also, don't forget to take this raincoat
over to our old friend.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-4-the-tale-of-granny-ame"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-the-tale-of-granny-ame">Volume 4: The Tale of Granny Ame</a></h2>
<p>After leaving Osen's house, I turned left, then right along a winding alley to a damp courtyard, and arrived at Granny
Ame's home. In the elegant courtyard, even the cicadas' chirps were silenced. There was only the quiet trickle of water
droplets in the suikinkutsu, accompanied by the rhythmic thumps of the shishi-odoshi. Long ago, in the mountains and
forests where youkai could lead carefree lives, the lady who could turn mist into rain was a good friend of the tanuki
and kitsune. Naturally, us youkai are vastly different from mortals. We don't have complicated troubles that plague us,
nor do we have things like status or class. But in the mountains shrouded in mist and rain, the soft-spoken Ameonna
always managed to gain more respect and adoration. It was later, when everyone had submitted to the Great Gongen. Good
times came for mortals, and youkai either lived in seclusion at various places, or were subjected to destruction and
suppression... It was then that Granny Ame moved to Toki Alley. As a token of sympathy, the Kitsune of Grand Narukami
Shrine, Lady Guuji, gave her this mansion. What kind of loss and sorrow led to Lady Guuji takins special care of Granny
Ame? I'm really curious.</p>
<p>Stopping briefly in the courtyard, I watched the crescent moon swaying in the pond, as her voice rang gently in the cool
night breeze.</p>
<p>&quot;My apologies to have kept you waiting for so long.&quot; When I turned around, I saw Ameonna standing by the door. She was
bathed in pale moonlight, her long white dress shone with a dewy sheen, but her young and slender figure exuded a
melancholic aura of a bygone era.</p>
<p>So, I looked down and hastily handed over the raincoat that Osen passed to me, not daring to look directly into her pale
gray eyes. It is rumored among mortals that the eyes of the sorrowful Ameonna will take on the marble gray-white hue of
a drowning person. Those who dare to look directly into these woeful eyes will be lost forever in the incomprehensible
fog of rain. Of course, that's just a silly legend among mortals, but the basic etiquette like &quot;Don't look into the eyes
of the sorrowful Ameonna&quot; is indeed an unwritten rule among youkai.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot; Granny Ame's voice was as soft and gentle as ever, like morning dew in the mist.</p>
<p>She didn't invite me in, nor did she share her story. All I was handed was a wooden box, but that's all I needed to
know. So, while the moon was bright, I quietly left the courtyard.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-the-tale-of-gonbei"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-the-tale-of-gonbei">Volume 5: The Tale of Gonbei</a></h2>
<p>Gonbei is 76 years old and is the only mortal living in Toki Alley. He was a farmer, a samurai, and a craftsman. The box
in my hand is his handiwork, its smooth black lacquer surface inlaid with an iridescent mother-of-pearl. This was a
craft he learned from the fishermen of Watatsumi Island.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for your hard work.&quot; The old man in front of me bowed his head deeply. Although I privately thought that this
was the way mortals were supposed to behave towards youkai, I still felt a twinge of pity for his melancholy.</p>
<p>According to Gonbei, contrary to popular legend, he was once close friends with the Ameonna who roamed the mountains and
forests. It's just that, Gonbei, who was a teenager at the time, was trying to bring rain to the drought-stricken fields
of his hometown. He thus heeded the village elder's words and went to the mountains to seek help from the Ameonna. At
that time, Granny Ame was no longer young and was keenly aware of the many changes in the world. But the beings of the
mountains and forests are always more simple and naïve, compared to mortals.</p>
<p>Hmm, what happened later? The young Gonbei made the unspeakable mistake of deceiving the beings of the mountains and
seas. Although to this day, he still insists that his deceit was to save his hometown.</p>
<p>And his village did have a rare harvest year because of the heavy rainfall. After that, Gonbei, who was deeply ashamed,
avoided the mountains far away and came to live in the city for a long time.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm so sorry.&quot; The elderly mortal bowed his head, but did not take the wooden box. I left his house, before the
moonlight was shrouded by dark clouds.</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-break-time"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-break-time">Volume 6: Break Time</a></h2>
<p>They say that in the past, before the fragile and short-lived mortals had crossed over the sea to these lands, Inazuma
was once a land that belonged to the tanuki. Lazy and fickle by nature, the tanuki never worried about tomorrow, nor did
they carry today's troubles with them through the night. During that period, the land of Inazuma was a cozy paradise for
the tanuki and every day was a fun-filled festival.</p>
<p>At least, that's what the tanuki elders say.</p>
<p>Later on, the kitsune arrived by sea, forcing the tanuki into a great war that lasted first for 800 years and then for
another 800 years, with both sides suffering heavy casualties, until eventually the only option was to hold peace talks.
The tanuki are a stubborn bunch and to this day still don't admit defeat, but the fact remains that they ceded the giant
Thunder Sakura to the kitsune.</p>
<p>But the kitsune are a crafty and cunning bunch too, and equally skilled in the art of shape-shifting. It is said that in
that great war, as a consequence of the constant switcheroo trickery, many poor souls became completely disoriented and
could not for the life of them keep track of who was who — eventually forgetting even who they were, what they were, and
which side they were supposed to be on.</p>
<p>Thus were the hapless mortals born. The product of bewildered youkai.</p>
<p>I wandered through the winding streets and alleys, while recapping the long-held stories of the tanuki clan. In the end,
I didn't find a restaurant that was still open.</p>
<p>I guess this means it's time to go back. With this in mind, I stood up and stretched my back in front of Uncle Kitsune's
soba stand.</p>
<p>Just then, a familiar scent came from behind—</p>

<p>It is often said that the &quot;drawn bow is like the quartered moon, and studying the blade is like a circle of transparent
jade.&quot;</p>
<p>It is said that when Narukami came to her people, she brought with her the knowledge of crafting swords. After thousands
of years and hundreds of bountiful harvests, mortal swordsmiths were at last able to make swords that would please even
Narukami herself. Thus did the Grand Shrine and the Shogunate enact this divine ceremony: they collected the greatest
swords in the world and offered them up to the shrine, thus naming these blades &quot;Goshintou.&quot; This ceremony was a very
lively one indeed, and the practice persists to the present period. However, there are many behind-the-curtain matters
concerning the &quot;Goushintou&quot; that few know of. No famous craftsman merely forges one blade in one sitting. The greatest
of their works are known as &quot;Shinuchi,&quot; and are given a lovely name before being offered to the craftsman's lord or
deity. These are not built for taking lives and are to remain pure. The others are known as &quot;Kageuchi&quot; and will be given
to retainers for them use as weapons. These will often be used to shed blood and will thus be stained with impurity and
filth.</p>
<p>From the day Narukami Gongen, the First Shogun, began her dominion over the land of Inazuma, she was accompanied by her
younger twin sister. &quot;Shin&quot; and &quot;Kage,&quot; light and dark they were, mediating and holding court, ordering and giving
battle. The younger of the two was named &quot;Ei,&quot; and if her name were to be written plainly, it would likely be the word
for &quot;shadow,&quot; which she was in relation to the first Shogun, to whom she would become the successor. As most know, only
The Seven emerged from the wrack and ruin of the war that rolled across the mortal world like a crimson storm. Though
the Shadow Shogun was divinely skilled in martial arts and unsurpassed with the blade, she believed herself little more
than a warrior with little understanding of mortal hearts. Thus, she chose to give up her bodily form, helping her
sister to ascend to the &quot;heavenly citadel&quot; and obtain dominion over Inazuma. Shortly after, the True Shogun, &quot;Makoto,&quot;
set up her Shogunate and began to rule over the land. Remembering their bond, she recalled &quot;Ei&quot;'s divine will and
reforged her body, thus returning her sister to her side once more as her kagemusha.</p>

<h2 id="volume-4-the-tale-of-the-researcher"><a class="header" href="#volume-4-the-tale-of-the-researcher">Volume 4: The Tale of the Researcher</a></h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there lived a researcher, upon whom all the hallmarks of the haughty man of letters might be seen,
though he himself — and we shall be generous to him here — was not the best amongst his peers. Knowledge is like a
fruit, after all, and time quickly whittles its freshness away. If he cannot eat it all while it is still juicy and
full, the rest shall taste like sweet decay.</p>
<p>&quot;Time,&quot; the young researcher said, &quot;you truly are my hated foe — even more so than I consider my colleagues.&quot;</p>
<p>Alas, innate characteristics such as laziness cannot be so easily shaken off. Thus did winters turn to summers and back
again, bringing his &quot;hated colleagues&quot; glory and praise, while he was left with the scars of the bygone years. Perhaps
this was some trick of fate, but our main character would indeed discover a way to make his wish reality — quite by
accident, in fact.</p>
<p>&quot;Time seems fair, though it is but a veneer. That I am not as quick-witted as others is not due to a lack of talent.
Nay, 'tis but the cruelty of time...&quot; So thought the researcher, now no longer young. &quot;Now that my chance has come, I
must use it well.&quot;</p>
<p>And so he made this wish to the injured Jinni: &quot;I wish for time to be just... so that I might write better theses.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jinni understood him quite easily, saying: &quot;All things come with a price.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes, and I have clearly paid part of that toll,&quot; he said, shrugging. &quot;I have wasted my youth on pointless
pursuits. Now that things have come to this point, I no longer desire common joys. I only wish to leave behind a work of
stunning brilliance, that my name will be praised for generations. Nor do I wish for my work to be left on perishable
ink and paper, but it shall instead be carved into stone. Thousands of years on, my marks shall still be left upon this
world... and this way, I shall have my justice — I shall triumph over time.</p>
<p>&quot;If that is your will,&quot; the Jinni replied noncommittally, fulfilling the researcher's wish nonetheless.</p>
<p>But whether that was truly a Jinni or some demon in disguise was quite the matter of contention, especially in
hindsight. Leaving this matter aside, the researcher whose wish was fulfilled found that everything had now become slow
compared to his thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;Good, good. Now then, my agility of mind shall not be a problem.&quot; At first, the researcher was most pleased. Now that
he had ample slack, so to speak, there was much time for thoughtful consideration. The time it took for a sand grain to
fall to the earth was not sufficient for him to raise his left hand to touch his forehead, but his mind could sprint
during this time — from forest to desert, from vast plain to snowy tundra it could run indeed. He cursed that all the
pages of a book could not be laid out flat, but had to be flipped one by one. But even had they been laid out before
him, his eyeballs would have failed to move quickly enough. By the time his eyes had finished resting upon a single
word, he would already have exhausted all vocabulary related to that word, and all imagination pertaining to that
vocabulary.</p>
<p>&quot;I think too much and write too little,&quot; the researcher thought afterwards. &quot;I must use the most elegant words to write
the most academically rigorous paper.&quot; But when he had penned the first word, his thoughts had already leaped to the
conclusion. And so he had to constantly repeat the essay to himself, and as he silently dictated the text, it would
become more and more refined. Yet, this could only happen in his mind — when all was said and done, his right hand had
yet to even write seven words.</p>
<p>And thus was this great work, comprised of the finest lexicon and the stoutest logic, compromised by the researcher's
own body. Every passage came out tattered, as if someone had shredded every page and put them back together haphazardly.
The words that were connected felt like fragments randomly selected from a complete text, and no one could really grasp
the connection between them.</p>
<p>It was on a starless night when he, with all his strength, like one completing a centuries-long exodus, managed to leave
his study, arriving at the courtyard downstairs.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps speaking shall be more direct than writing,&quot; he said, a single bare thread of hope remaining in his heart. But
his very voice seemed to stumble after the weave of his thoughts. His syllables came out disjointed and fragmentary — as
if the intent behind the words had changed even as they were being said, and so they came out as mere mumbling and
whimpering.</p>
<p>&quot;Alas, poor old fellow! One might almost think he has been possessed!&quot; So said the well-dressed young folk who looked
upon him with sympathy. &quot;But at least he still has the moon.&quot;</p>
<p>They left after saying these words, leaving the researcher alone in the moon-bathed courtyard, trapped in the prison he
once called a body. Then the mere husk of a mortal man began to recall a story that he had once read...</p>
<h2 id="volume-5-the-tale-of-the-mirror-the-palace-and-the-dreamer"><a class="header" href="#volume-5-the-tale-of-the-mirror-the-palace-and-the-dreamer">Volume 5: The Tale of the Mirror, the Palace, and the Dreamer</a></h2>
<p>Night after night, she would always dream about that distant palace. Its intricate structure was formed of infinite
corners, arcades, and passages, and at each corner would be hung a silver mirror with a gilded frame. It was said that
the king spent 200 years (6 years more must be added if one wishes to follow the numbering of years in those days) to
design this place, and when seated upon the throne, he could gaze into any mirror, and through its exquisitely planned
and winding paths of light, one could glimpse any corner of his realm. Yet when she looked into the mirrors at the ends
of the hallways in her dream, all she could see was a blurry image: that of a masked young woman garbed in fine raiment,
wearing lovely ornaments, walking through the opulent corridors, like a heat haze in the flaming gold of day. She knew
then her purpose, though it might seem strange — she wished to gain an audience with that king and tell him something,
for these words had been put into her heart and were not hers to command, though she would always leave those words
somewhere in the warping mirror-lights each time she awoke with a start.</p>
<p>Year after year, in her dreams as clear as dawn, she would try — and fail — to find the way to the throne, nor would she
ever witness that king in person. The young lady who was once lost amongst the mirrors was now a famed magician, and
even so, in those stolen dreaming moments, in those flashes of unconscious lucidity, those fantastical thoughts still
had her soul in their iron grip. One day, the great mage discovered clues to reaching that distant kingdom at last.
Forsaking all that the worldly might hold dear, she set out on her journey alone. Across mottled moonlight she sailed,
through the shadowed valleys she strode, and the darkest forests she braved, until she, at last, reached that realm of
her dreams. But alas, alas! That city had been annihilated in a terrible fire a few hundred years ago, and the
once-prosperous kingdom was now no more. It is just as the poets say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The morning breeze is forgotten by all,<br />
Song and color have faded from sight.<br />
Only the dim gleam of towers tall,<br />
Lights the ruined, barren night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She entered the devastated palace and walked amidst its ruins. The mirrors and their gilded frames had long been
shattered, with naught but their shattered wrack remaining, each splinter reflecting a beam of chilling moonlight. The
court was not as bizarre or strange as it had been in her dreams — in a few mere corners and a few corridors, she was
knocking on the door of the throne room. It was a circular hall with hundreds of mirrors hanging from the stone walls —
though like the mirrors in the hallways, these had also mostly been destroyed. The mage subconsciously walked towards
that long-vacated throne and sat down, casting her gaze upon one of the still-whole mirrors.</p>
<p>In that mirror, she beheld again that masked young woman garbed in fine raiment, walking amidst the opulent halls, and
behind her, the mirrors — mirrors that had never been shattered — reflected a thousand reflections of her form. She
startled and raised her head, for that young woman now stood before her, silently watching, unimaginable pain in her
eyes. The mage had only just thought of something to say when the woman drew a dagger — before stabbing her in the
heart. A lustrous rose-bloom graced the silent tip of the blade as flames ignited all around them, consuming the hall
that had once been destroyed by a great blaze once more.</p>
<p>She smiled in confusion, astonishment, and relief, for the woman then took her mask off, revealing the features of the
mage herself, dry lips quivering ever so slightly.</p>
<p>This time, the mage could finally hear the other person's words — words that had become lost across the decades and
centuries within this labyrinthine dream and its eventide bewilderment. It was a story, a story told by her to herself,
a story reflected in thousands of shattered slivers of silver, echoing on and on, forever...</p>
<h2 id="volume-6-tale-of-the-bird-chaser"><a class="header" href="#volume-6-tale-of-the-bird-chaser">Volume 6: Tale of the Bird Chaser</a></h2>
<p>This is a story of an old bird chaser.</p>
<p>North of the kingdom lies a dense forest. It is home to a flock of birds that can mimic the words of humans. They often
gather like a cloud by the break of the dawn. As they fly in the forest iridescent hues dance on their spread wings, and
their chatters echo round the tree crowns. But these creatures are not alone, for an old and frail man dressed in
tattered rags always comes and spends all day chasing after them like a savage.</p>
<p>Just as how a towering tree was once tender and delicate, the old man used to be fair and handsome. He grew up in a
village by the forest. Agile and kind, he was much-loved by all.</p>
<p>Every girl in the village adored him, but his heart fluttered only for his love, a young priestess serving in the forest
who always fascinated him with miracles of the divine.</p>
<p>The young man often thought that he would give up anything to be with the girl, until death did them apart. Alas, that
which is sweet never lasts. A grueling war broke out, and the young were conscripted, including the man. Before he left
for the battlefield, he saw his love weep for the first time. Teardrops rolled down her cheeks like dew falling from a
green leaf — then down into his heart. Yet little did he know the actual reason behind the girl's melancholia. He made
hasty promises, wishing to ease the girl's sorrow — one caused by departure, as he then naively believed.</p>
<p>With grief written all over her face, the girl gave no response to his beautiful vows. After a brief silence, she said
she would send talking birds to relay her words of longing. It was an unusual use of power, but the young man took her
act as a means to secure his love. So he nodded.</p>
<p>The young man departed the next day to honor his duty to his kingdom. It would soon be over, he thought. But reality
eventually proved him wrong — the war dragged on and on. It was not until stubble grew on his chin and his eyes and
hands became battle-hardened that the dust finally settled.</p>
<p>His only solace in this brutal war was the birds from his hometown. As if guided by the gods, they always managed to
come to him on quiet nights, carrying her words — the whispers of her bitter-sweet longing, telling him of changes in
the village, or of a few short verses she wrote him.</p>
<p>The sustained separation had not diminished his love for her. Instead, if love was a monument, it would be driven into
his heart.</p>
<p>When the war finally ended, he hurried home to propose to his beloved, only to find that she had died of an acute
illness on a cold night shortly after his departure.</p>
<p>The young man refused to accept it, for he had just been visited by a talking bird the previous day, when his young
priestess read him beautiful prose through its mouth.</p>
<p>He broke into the girl's closed chamber. But as the sunlight filled the dim room, it stirred what was inside: countless
enchanted birds waiting to be awakened from their rich slumber. In a single instant, the birds rushed past him, wings
flapping by his ears, and flew through the open floor into the sky like an ethereal cloud, returning to their home. At
last, the young man stood alone, his love's empty room before him.</p>
<p>It finally dawned on him why the girl had made the most unusual arrangement with that saddened expression on her face
the night they parted.</p>
<p>It had been an arrangement for a lifetime — on her dying bed, she must taught the birds countless words, more than
enough to fill his every night since with a flicker of light.</p>
<p>Birds live far longer than humans think. From that day on, the young man has been chasing the talking birds in the
forest. In their voices, he seeks to catch her lingering soul, to repent for his sin of scattering her love in the
woods. Maddened yet tireless, the young man has not stopped his chase for a single day as he turned into a middle-aged
man, then aged into an old man. The talking birds now speak of nothing new, and their numbers have dwindled. But what if
there is still one that he has not yet met — one with something from her that he has not yet known? The obsession traps
the bird chaser in the forest and upon his face is written the toll of years.</p>
<p>He skillfully sets up traps very catch the birds and keeps them in a cage, stroking their necks, playing with them, and
giving them the best cereals and clearest water. Then, he will say to them, &quot;Speak, Talking Birds, speak of my love, who
the forest favored so dearly. Speak of what she taught you.&quot;</p>
<p>And so, the generously-fed birds will tell such a story...</p>

<p>O Nagarjuna,<br />
Aided by the light of countless spirits, I bless this land of eternal calamity. When the sludge of the deepest depths of
the abyss stained the first kingdom, The glorious spirits that aided the Lord of Wisdom dispersed a million ways. I
crossed back over the River of Sorrow in my thirst for spring water. I opened a path for the benevolent spirits so that
the merciful light of wisdom may illuminate the four corners.</p>
<p>O Nagarjuna,<br />
Aided by the light of numberless spirits, I nourish the benevolent spirits in the sea of flowers. Behold, the spirits'
light reveals the essence of the spirit, the final descendant of the god of grass and trees. Behold, the warrior who
remains after a hundred battles is the Devs' foe. Not even the inky gloom from beyond the skies can erode their forms.</p>
<p>O Nagarjuna,<br />
Aided by the light of a million spirits, I have transcended the dead of this foul earth. Cleanse the sinless of their
sins, so that they may be reborn in a pure land free of suffering. In the chakras of the earth are contained the karmic
seeds that will give birth to all things. The fleeting blights and glories of the earthly realm are naught but the
illusion of existing seeds.</p>
<p>O Nagarjuna,<br />
Aided by the light of countless spirits, I have cleansed the abyss of heaven above. The sludge welling up from the
depths of the abyss has finally receded, The legacy of Dahri, too, has submitted to the law. A thousand songs were sung
in unison, and the heavy rains abated for a time.</p>

If the dark tide reappears and the black abyss returns, Sing this hymn and pray for that prevailing light of the
spirits. That eternal light of the spirits will guide us on our path upwards.</p>

<p>...When the Mistress of Pushpavatika heard this, she did not hesitate to humble herself. Resolute, she descended upon
the grand palace of (...) with the intention of testing the princess's wisdom. Countless maids, servants, and escorts
surrounded the ever-gleaming princess, All dressed in fine linen and silk, like thousands of daytime stars wreathed
around the only shining moon.</p>
<p>(Herbad of Haravatat Tafazzoli's Remarks: There is a mistranslation here — The word &quot;silk&quot; in the last sentence should
be translated as &quot;a textile that no one had ever seen before&quot; so as not to lead the reader to confuse it with Liyue's
regional specialty. Additionally, the &quot;grand palace&quot; mentioned in the second sentence is not a true &quot;palace&quot; in the
original text, nor does it refer to any actual &quot;building.&quot; Rather, it refers to &quot;a land where the divine is present.&quot; It
would seem that the researchers of Vahumana who undertook the translation of this volume did not really understand the
language of that era, but I shall earnestly annotate this document all the same.)</p>
<p>...The sweet fragrance lingered on the princess on that (hedge? garden? battlefield?), Like a stream winding around the
shattered silver moonlight under the shade of a tree. From ancient times till now, none have ever beheld such beauty as
this, Just as none have ever witnessed the descent of morning frost in the seventh month.</p>
<p>(Herbad of Haravatat Tafazzoli's Remarks: The word in the first sentence, of which the meaning cannot be determined for
the time being, could also be translated as &quot;farmland&quot; or &quot;cemetery&quot;. Herbad of Vahumana Yarshater's Remarks: Many
thanks for your comments, Master Tafazzoli. Now we're even more confused as to who the author of this book is writing
about.)</p>
<p>...Thus, the Mistress of Pushpavatika spoke: &quot;Praise be to the Winged One, lord over all the kingdoms of the land.&quot; &quot;I
am a spirit created at the beginning, I am a flickering illusion, I am the shimmering light that flows from the eyes of
the creator.&quot; &quot;People in far-flung lands sing praises of your wisdom. I wonder then if you could help me to unravel
something that has long bewildered me?&quot; &quot;I will give you these spices, gold, and precious stones as a token of my
appreciation if you can solve my three riddles.&quot;</p>
<p>That princess of (...) answered thusly: &quot;Praise be to the Winged One, the truth that rules over all the kingdoms of the
land.&quot; &quot;I am the owner of yesterday and the master of tomorrow morning, but never have I seen beauty and elegance such
as yours.&quot; &quot;Mistress of Pushpavatika, whatever doubts you may harbor in your mind, you may raise them with me without
reservation.&quot; &quot;For these spices, gold, and precious stones, even when added together, cannot compare to the value of
imparting knowledge.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-18"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-18">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>Thus, the Mistress of Pushpavatika spoke again: &quot;Benevolent Princess, if your sincerity is true,&quot; &quot;Then allow me to
recite the first riddle.&quot; &quot;What is cold as the dead while alive,&quot; &quot;Yet gives warmth upon death?&quot;</p>
<p>That princess of (...) answered thusly: &quot;You speak of the fragile rose of late spring. Even when covered in thorns, her
beauty shines through.&quot; &quot;Her flowers plucked to make perfume, her stems snipped into the wicks of oil lamps.&quot; &quot;Lovers
throughout history have been smitten by her, and even the king in red admires her beauty.&quot; &quot;But the rose has never pined
for anyone. She merely withers with the new moon and morning dew.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mistress of Pushpavatika secretly approved, yet her beautiful face remained as calm as ever. Taking a casual step
forward, she recited the second riddle.</p>
<p>So said the Mistress of Pushpavatika: &quot;O wise Princess, you have answered my first riddle.&quot; &quot;But from the stars to the
abyss, many inexplicable secrets still exist in the world.&quot; &quot;O wise Princess, if your wisdom is truly as the legends of
the people say,&quot; &quot;Please answer my second riddle as you did the first.&quot; &quot;What rises from the earth, then descends from
the sky,&quot; &quot;No one has seen it, yet it sees all,&quot; &quot;As above, so below, and as at the bottom, so too, the top,&quot; &quot;Yet only
top to bottom may be, and never bottom to top?&quot;</p>
<p>That princess of (...) answered thusly: &quot;You speak of the universal law created in heaven, the divine laws established
in the beginning.&quot; &quot;No one has seen the eternal law, yet it governs all.&quot; &quot;One may only bow down and worship Vaana of
the heavenly spirits — no arrogation, deception, or trickery is permitted.&quot; &quot;If one dares to imitate the forbidden arts,
only calamity awaits at the edge of divine knowledge.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-15"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-15">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>The Mistress of Pushpavatika almost jumped for joy, but her beautiful face remained cold. Bowing ever so slightly, she
recited her third riddle.</p>
<p>Thus said the Mistress of Pushpavatika: &quot;O wise Princess, you have grasped the secrets between the stars and abyss.&quot;
&quot;But there are more things in this world than the transient — for some things are eternal in their brilliance.&quot; &quot;O wise
Princess, if your wisdom is truly as the legends of the people say,&quot; &quot;Please answer my final question as you did my
second riddle.&quot; &quot;What cannot stop arrows, yet can stop destruction,&quot; &quot;Cannot destroy armor, yet can destroy cities,&quot;
&quot;Does not submit to envoys from above, nor kingdoms down below,&quot; &quot;What can neither gods nor demons, for all their might,
prevail over?&quot;</p>
<p>That princess of (...) answered thusly: &quot;You speak of endless wisdom, it is what protects the civilization of (...).&quot;
&quot;It will be reborn with (...), and remain eternal like (...).&quot; &quot;Even if the sands of time swirl beneath its feet, it
will still remain like (...) ten million years after.&quot; &quot;The people will rejoice because of its (...), and it will (...)
because of them.&quot;</p>
<p>(Herbad of Haravatat Tafazzoli's Remarks: The omissions here are not intentional. Instead, they are due to the damaged
state of the book. Some omissions can be inferred from the remains of the original. Regrettably, the researchers of

in part. The missing word in the first segment: &quot;Mine (Ours),&quot; &quot;Eternity,&quot; or &quot;All,&quot; The missing word in the third

<p>The princess had answered all three riddles, and no secrets could stymie her. The Mistress of Pushpavatika could not
help but feel utmost admiration toward the princess.</p>
<p>Thus, the Mistress of Pushpavatika spoke: &quot;O benevolent, wise, and eternal Princess,&quot; &quot;Your wisdom does far surpass the
legends.&quot; &quot;Blessed are your kin, fortunate are your people,&quot; &quot;For they can be by your side, heeding your teachings.&quot;</p>

<p>...I don't dare presume to mention her true name, let alone overstep my bounds as an earthly being to judge her
divinity. I, Sunitha Cosamvi, a servant of shallow intellect, have merely recorded the stories heard from the sages who
followed her in the past and nowhere else. These words are as true and evident as my own existence.</p>
<p>When the moon's shadow shattered, hordes of beasts emerged from the deepest depths of the abyss and devoured living
creatures by the thousands. Of those she created, none could escape their destined annihilation. The goodness, peace,
and wisdom she had bestowed — all perished before this pure malice without exception. Under that sneering waning moon,
the black tide of decay surged over the deserts and through the valleys, turning clear springs once interlaced with
roses into puddles of filth, defiling the earth as mortals trembled with despair. The sages called it The Black Tide,
for it was a dark flood that swallowed up fields, villages, and cities.</p>
<p>She witnessed this all with her own eyes and wept bitterly for the sorrow and suffering of the living. Her tears fell to
the ground, dispelling the foul flames and giving birth to blossoms abounding with sweet dew from the once barren and
scorched earth. However, the root cause of the blight still lay beneath the earth, and the shadow of death continued to
obscure the once luminous moonlight. Thus, she vowed to save the creatures of the earth, embarking on a final journey
together with her followers.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-19"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-19">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>She followed the dappled light and shade until she entered a long-since ruined forest. With each step she took, a
thousand Nilotpala Lotuses bloomed in her wake. Every calamity — raging fires, death, and destruction — all receded
before the wonder of her wisdom. Fragrant flowers bloomed and proliferated again in this dead domain and remain as
abundant today as the gravel in the Ardravi River. Even hurricanes abated into gentle exhalations before her singing,
causing the bells on her lapels to sway as they rang out elegantly. All the spirits, their envoys, humans, and the
inhuman rejoiced and praised her name, for she is indeed the most sagacious and the most merciful.</p>
<p>In the depths of the forest, she collected grass to use as an instrument, picked flowers for a crown, and played a
flawless tune with a Karrenay. In an instant, thousands of demonic troops were reduced to dust and scattered to the four
winds, never to be found again. She gently brushed away the tears of the forest creatures and soothed their anguish,
just as she once blew the wind of life across the barren sea of sand, like the emissary of an eternal oasis from time
immemorial.</p>
<p>But this land remained broken, its heart devoured by evil spirits and monsters who made it their dwelling — a cavern of
the damned where neither sun, moon, nor fire shine. The dust they took for treasure and the sludge served as their
delicacies, like birds clad in feathers but unable to soar in the skies. She decided that she would go to the dark cave
and enter that evil place that none might depart, continuing on this path of no restitution, this sojourn of utmost
purity and mercy.</p>
<p>She stepped alone to that emptied earthly heart and softly touched its timeless face, becoming the immortal Gaokerena
and the earth itself. Every thread of spiritual knowledge and every sweet-smelling plant is her undying will. Another
flourishing sea of flowers rolled around her, jade in color, rosy in fragrance and dewy as heavenly raiment. The songs
of a hundred birds surrounded her, praising the life that she had at last reclaimed, like a mortal trading their old
clothes for fresh ones, casting off their original shackles, and ascending to the eternal temple.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3-16"><a class="header" href="#volume-3-16">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Many people had never before heard her voice, or if they had, they did not know it was her. Those who disseminate well
because they hear words from far and wide are as rare as those who teach well because they understand the truth. Her
will is all-pervading and as indestructible as intellect itself. None can destroy the indestructible, for there has
never been an absence of existence in this world, nor the existence of absence.</p>
<p>It must be known that the forest was once overrun by a black tide of beasts. The moonlight spilling over the still water
was as shattered as the dream it reflected, and the endless labyrinth too collapsed in the burning flames. The lord of
all animals let out a furious roar with its dying breath, then fell protecting all that she had entrusted to him. But
the memories themselves did not shatter, collapse, nor fall. Like the wisdom she left behind, they were unborn,
imperishable, eternal, and ancient.</p>
<p>Following her guidance, the princess of the kingdom of dreams gently snapped off the white branches and rebuilt the
verdant hunting grounds from the withered fallen leaves, while the children of the forest, having set forth their
ambition, were able to sleep peacefully in the end once more. No matter how much they suffer, the hunter always finds
their way home — This is the first and final promise she made to the children, and to the adults who were once children.
Perhaps the moon dust scattered over the world will one day fade away like morning dew, but for those things that remain
in memories — all those sweet dreams and thoughts — their purity will remain as unchanged as a pearl that even the
grinding and whittling of a thousand winds and sands may not alter.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-lay-of-al-ahmar"><a class="header" href="#the-lay-of-al-ahmar">The Lay of Al-Ahmar</a></h1>
<p>According to the desert dwellers, the world was once ruled by a king named Al-Ahmar, a king of warriors,
horticulturists, and sages. He controlled the winds whistling through the desert, the dunes turned bright silver by
moonlight, and the one thousand and one Jinn who hid within the night and the calls of owls.</p>
<p>They say that Al-Ahmar was a son of the sky. That is why he was known as the king of the world and received the fervent
faith of countless people from the three great tribes, and was even adored by the elusive Jinn. Whenever he looked up to
the sky and recalled the boundless paradise high above, and the merciless reign of thousands of years past, Al-Ahmar
could not help but lower his noble head and sigh helplessly. In such moments, even the songs of the nightingale and the
aroma of roses could not pull him from his sorrow.</p>
<p>The desert dwellers knew well that the ravings of nostalgia often presaged the arrival of calamity. But in that world
where the wise enjoyed peace and happiness, and in the era where brave young men and women courted like lions and roses,
no one foresaw the arrival of catastrophe. But how should we blame the people and spirits of the past? Even one as wise
as the greatest of sages, Hermanubis, could never have known that the valiant tribe that once could equal the dragons
would be reduced to corpse-eating monsters a thousand years later, and that their sullied honor and bones would be
buried for eternity beneath the gilded dunes. How could he have known that the tribe of the wise, known for generations
of sages, would lose our texts and become wandering bards of the desert, mourning our emperor with songs that only the
Jinn understand? It is as the sages say: a mere thought can yet often bring forth calamity, if it is from the
undisguised melancholy and madness of a king.</p>
<p>Thus did the three retainers of Al-Ahmar (may seven times seven curses fall upon them!) present their strategy to the
king:</p>
<p>&quot;Your Majesty, ruler of the world, lord of the four corners of the earth, king over Jinn and mortals alike.&quot; The Goat
King, the minister of all ministers, spoke flatteringly, &quot;I humbly beg your pardon if I overstep, but Your Majesty, I'm
certain you are aware that indulging in dreams of old and sorrows of the past is no way to be for long. The endless
power and wisdom of this land can build you a palace that surpasses the heavens, Your Majesty, and it shall bring your
people a prosperous future.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Al-Ahmar said with a frown, and the Goat King fell silent.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Majesty, son of the sky, subjugator of gods, and greatest of all sages,&quot; The Ibis King, the scribe of all scribes,
advised, &quot;The divine punishment of a thousand years past brought the downfall of wisdom and history. For a better
future, Your Majesty, you should take control of the past. The present oases hold the wisdom of the 'present', but if we
are to seize the 'past', we must act swiftly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; Al-Ahmar struck the ground with his staff, and the Ibis King fell silent.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Majesty, lord of dunes and oases, guide of the living and the dead, master of all elements.&quot; The Crocodile King,
the commander of commanders, spoke frankly, &quot;If we are to recall the lost lives and welcome lost opportunities and
dreams back into the fold, then this is our final chance. The greater the authority, the greater the emptiness. The
greater the wisdom, the greater the sorrow. Forget the delusions of the Void. Only resurrection and life eternal can
fill the endless pit of regret.&quot;</p>
<p>Al-Ahmar fell silent.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine.&quot;</p>
<p>The arbitrary king heeded his retainers' lies. Thus did Al-Ahmar use a hundred years and a hundred years further to
build a huge maze for his kingdom, before trapping himself deep within it in search of forbidden knowledge and an elixir
with which he might abandon his mortal form.</p>
<p>The subsequent events are knowledge that should not be revisited. They should be eternally forgotten by any rational
history.</p>
<p>According to the legends of the desert dwellers, in just one night, the kingdom of wisdom and power was buried by the
sands of retribution. They say Al-Ahmar separated his mind from his flesh and bone, placing it within the corridors,
stairways, doorways, and beams that crawled eternally into the depths. It is said that Al-Ahmar's body gradually decayed
on his throne while worms feasted on it, and that his soul merged into one with the wailing souls of the millions in his
kingdom, doomed to wander, lost amidst the howling end, traveling along the dark and winding corridors, growing ever
closer to the bottomless abyss...</p>
<p>Thus did the minds of millions merge into one, a lone soul that would eventually succumb to madness. And so, Al-Ahmar's
kingdom was built and destroyed by his own hand.</p>
<p>They say that when that night came, the desert quaked, and the walls of Al-Ahmar's royal city collapsed. One thousand
and one pillars trembled before the gale, and the bulls and griffins that once stood proudly atop them, gazing down at
the lifeless dunes, now reluctantly fell into its gilded embrace. Countless people, sage or fool, hero or coward — all
of them vanished within the sandstorm that night. The lucky survivors fell into eternal silence. It's said that they
were made blind and mute as punishment for their sin of benefitting from forbidden knowledge. The sages say that trying
to keep knowledge for yourself is ignorance, and that the punishment for ignorance is ignorance itself.</p>
<p>As for the descendants of the ignorant who have lost their history, the Eremites say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have returned from the land of the lost,<br />
The sky of the ages we have changed,<br />
Fear shall not stop us,<br />
No god shall we heed.<br />
Across the ocean of sand akin to gravel,<br />
To its end we shall sail.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-shepherd-and-the-magic-bottle"><a class="header" href="#the-shepherd-and-the-magic-bottle">The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle</a></h1>
<p>Legend has it that King Al-Ahmar, while still alive, had collected numerous Jinn and demons from across the world,
placing them within magic bottles. Legend has it that the world was once teeming with such Jinn. Al-Ahmar, mighty yet
bewildered, seized them from the silver night winds and quicksands of the desert, the mystical swirls of the ocean, and
the tinkling springs in the rainforest, and kept them in silver bottles. He was like an arrogant conqueror, and at the
same time, a curious child.</p>
<p>Al-Ahmar harnessed the spirits with bridles and yokes, learned from their laments about the story of the dismal moon and
the driving morning star, and built the majestic Ay-Khanoum — the &quot;City of Amphitheaters,&quot; or &quot;City of the Moon Maiden&quot;
— to commemorate them. It is said to have been the city of the spirits, the paradise for migrants from the moon, gifted
to them by Al-Ahmar. In return, the spirits constructed the huge doorway to his masoleum.</p>
<p>This is the tale as the desert singers would tell it. Countless years later, Ay-Khanoum — like Saleh, the city of the
valiant Thamudians, Tulaytullah, the land of the wise Tighnarians, and Orghana, the city of the Twenty-Nine Deys — has
long been buried beneath heavy sands and swirling currents, as have the countless clans that inhabited it and the
innumerable Jinn imprisoned in their silver magic bottles.</p>
<p>But now, let us leave the unnecessary fact-finding to one side and return to the subject...</p>
<p>Fifteen years after Port Ormos was built, a young shepherd found a silver bottle in the Gravelsong Dunes (Note 1).
Whether out of childish curiosity or a recklessness uncharacteristic of desert dwellers, the boy broke the seal beneath
the silver bottle and opened it beneath the moonlight. (Note 2)</p>
<p>&quot;The ravens of the mortal world are so exceptionally noisy...&quot; A Jinni arose from within the bottle (Note 3) in the form
of a dancer, as flexible and languid as a cat and as bright and beautiful as a water lily. &quot;Ravens...?&quot; The youth was
clueless, as he did not resemble a bird, nor was he noisy. &quot;Yes, ravens.&quot; The spirit repeated, rather impatiently.
&quot;Birds that live fast and die fast, a noisy lot and no mistake... 'Only when they die do they wake up.' What about this
is there to not understand, hmm?&quot; The young man shook his head in confusion, bringing a sigh to the spirit's lips.
&quot;Listen, foolish bird.&quot; The spirit shook her head, her myrrh-scented braids swaying gently in the moonlight, the golden
bells dangling at their ends ringing dreamily, but her amber eyes glinting like daggers.</p>
<p>&quot;I will allow you to ask three questions under three conditions...&quot; &quot;First, do not defame my lord Al-Ahmar. This is my
bottom line. (Note 4)&quot; &quot;Second, harbor you no arrogance. Short-lived mortals should know where they stand.&quot; &quot;Third, do
not pry into the affairs of heaven and earth. Know this: there are indeed brave guardians and splendid stars in heaven.&quot;
&quot;If you fail to comply, I will fly into your mouth and nose on the night wind, like the three moon goddesses on their
steeds, draw out your guts and soul, and make your lifeless flesh my new home.&quot;</p>
<p>The youngster hastened to cover his mouth and nose, nodding profusely to show that he understood the conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;Then ask, beloved child of my lord, slave of heaven.&quot; Said the spirit, chuckling. The bright moonlight fell on her
braids, and flowed into her nearly transparent skin, granting it a crystalline sheen. &quot;Who are you?&quot; The young man
asked. &quot;I'm a creation of the sky, yet also a creature of this world. I'm an exile of the ages, a faithful servant to my
great lord. I'm an elemental spirit who will not bow to flesh and blood, an eternal prisoner content with the illusion
of comfort...&quot; The spirit held her head up high with pride, letting moonlight flow through her translucent body, her
golden bells ringing in the desert wind. &quot;As a descendant of Liloufar, I can be big or small. I can rise or hide. My
kindred may be found in the waves, in the night wind, or in the pale light of the dead moon. In short, I'm a spirit, and
I'm proud of who I am.&quot; &quot;Then why are you in this bottle?&quot; The young man shook the silver bottle in his hand and asked
uncomprehendingly. &quot;My lord Al-Ahmar aspired to conquer the world. All mountains and seas would be his to command. To
this end, he made us magic bottles of silver and stamped his mark on us, and so we became his servants, engaging in
noble deeds of creation and exploration. In other words... we were not servants in shame, but servants with pride.&quot; &quot;But
afterwards...&quot; The spirit said quietly, her amber eyes darkening. &quot;My lord brought disaster upon himself, leaving us
sentenced to generations of oblivion. We were trapped in sealed silver bottles, drowning in dreams until the moment of
our death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, your third question, then!&quot; The spirit waved her hand briskly, causing a clear jingle of the ancient silver coins
adorning her wrists. &quot;Have a care for your query, or your mouth and nose will suffer!&quot; &quot;So...&quot; The young man hesitated
for a moment, and asked the last question. &quot;What's it like to live in a bottle?&quot;</p>
<p>Seemingly having never heard of such a question before, the spirit was slightly surprised before she answered slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;In the first era, I lived in a carefree palace, singing with nightingales and talking with roses. It was a beautiful
time, a time when poets and lovers were born because of me. In those days, it seemed that the entire City of the Moon
Maiden was in the bottle, and even the tasteless spring water was intoxicating.&quot; &quot;At that time, I told myself that if
anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would curse and kill them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the era that came after, sandstorms and demons ran riot. Nightingales sang till their voice grew raspy and their
blood dried up. Roses withered and turned into tangles of thorns. Poets died of maltreatment, lovers were displaced,
prosperity vanished... It was a dreadful time when everything came to a standstill in the eternal collapse. Yet
likewise, the City of the Moon Maiden seemed to be right in the bottle.&quot; &quot;So I told myself that if anyone ever broke the
seal and let me out into the outside world, I would fight against its injustice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then in the third era, everything was reduced to dust. The grand play of the City of the Moon Maiden came to an end,
and what remained were the ruined theater and the wrecked masks of the gods. In that era, I ran out of tears to shed,
and the chiming golden bells and the fluttering veil became to me a haunting curse.&quot; &quot;And so, I told myself amidst that
desolation that if anyone ever broke the seal and let me out into the outside world, I would turn into an evil seeking
revenge — I would destroy the world, or else destroy myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So...&quot; A gust of cold wind in the desert sent a shiver over the young man, causing him to tighten his loose robe.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I could have made you the first target of my revenge... tore your bones and flesh to make a cruel song of your
soul.&quot; The spirit smiled teasingly, like a nightingale announcing a death on a summer night. &quot;Yet the dead moon cast a
glow over the quicksand dunes, and over me... and I suddenly realized how lovely the world is.&quot; &quot;And so this poor Jinni,
like a chick struggling to break through its egg, has hopelessly fallen in love with this barren and ravaged world and
its circle of life and death. The proud Jinni, once nourished by the delicacies of roses, has fallen for the land
infested with toads and vipers...&quot; &quot;It all makes me wonder what it will be like... when the 'raven' becomes the
'groom.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So...?&quot; The youngster cowered again.</p>
<p>&quot;So, tell me a story, little raven. Let me see the world.&quot; The spirit grinned slyly at the sight of the youth's puzzled
look, her golden bells tinkling at the end of her braids.</p>
<p>And so, the spirit of the moon maiden's city once again embarked on her journey around the world.</p>

<h2 id="volume-1-22"><a class="header" href="#volume-1-22">Volume 1</a></h2>
<p>&quot;The next story I'll tell comes from the age of Shiruyeh, the Lord of Pestilence, though at this time, that vassal ruler
had not yet gained notoriety for Shiruyeh's Plague, nor had his subjects been scattered amidst a world of darkness, left
to become wild creatures who had lost their language and faces...&quot; The fairy of the moon maiden's city paused for a
moment, then stretched out lazily. The moonlit silver coins jangled on her wrists and ankles as if displeased with the
jouncing of the Sumpter Beast. &quot;Anyway, little raven, do you know the meaning of the name &quot;Shiruyeh&quot;?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh... 'One who is ridiculous and despicable'?&quot; The youth whom she had rather one-sidedly named &quot;Raven&quot; answered
casually. Suffering the heat of the sun and the threat of quicksand, he had little interest in his travel companion's
stories. &quot;In our tribe, 'Shiruyeh' is a disgraceful name branded only onto the foreheads of exiled chiefs and spoken
only in curses and mockery. It's a tradition of ours... But I'm sure that the traditions of other tribes are not so
different.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha! Mortal awareness is just like quicksand, shifting with the winds of time. How bizarre!&quot; &quot;Raven&quot; replied
perfunctorily, drawing an unexpectedly enthusiastic taunt from the fairy, &quot;Now, actually... in the lost language,
'Shiruyeh' means 'unweaned lion cub'. His father Parvezravan gave this name to his newborn son, oblivious that he, the
vassal king who referred to himself as the 'Spirit of Unceasing Victory,' would be torn apart by his own beloved 'lion
cub'...&quot;</p>
<p>The fairy paused, seemingly afraid that her audience was getting bored, and exchanged glances with the youth before
continuing her tale: &quot;As for this Parvezravan, legend has it that in the days when mortals ruled as vassal kings, he was
one of the mightiest among them...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Parvezravan was not, in fact, the original name of this vassal king. As the spirits tell it, he was an orphan who was
raised in the nest of the giant bird Ghoghnus and given the name 'Kisra,' or 'one who has been bestowed a good name.'
Later, his aspiration to greatness and the aid of this divine bird saw him adopted by the vassal king Ormazd Shah, and
he would eventually rise to become a sage and hero among mortals.</p>
<p>In the songs of the now-vanished desert people, Kisra plundered the four corners of the land in the name of his king,
Ormazd Shah. By his hand, the bronze and mortar towers of ninety-nine cities were destroyed or abandoned. By his hand,
the leaders of ninety-nine nomadic tribes were defeated. And by his hand, ninety-nine sages with knowledge of the order
of the stars were bound in golden chains, then led back to the towering royal city of Gurabad to be imprisoned.</p>
<p>At that time, the promised land of &quot;Valivija&quot; was engulfed by wild, gilded sands, and one of the three living gods had
fallen. Amidst a century of chaos and confusion, the scattered mortals ensconced themselves in vassal states until my
lord Al-Ahmar and the Sage-King of the Greenwood gathered their subjects. Once the oasis paradise was reconstructed, the
age of the vassal kings, the age of division, finally came to a close.</p>
<p>Returning to our preceding tale, Ormazd's crown grew all the more valuable on the back of Kisra's exploits, until
finally his own neck could no longer bear its weight, forcing him to leave it ever suspended from chains of pure gold in
the center of the main hall.</p>
<p>The vassal king Ormazd Shah rewarded young Kisra's unrivaled achievements amply: He bestowed the name &quot;Parvez&quot; upon his
adopted son and offered his daughter Shirin's hand to him in marriage. In the ethereal songs of the spirits, as the heir
of both the mortal vassal king and the foremother Liloufar, she possessed superior wisdom and was blessed with an
infinite lifespan and, like the original sages, could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of the present moment.</p>
<p>If Kisra Parvez had stopped there, his reputation as a hero would have continued unblemished. But one cursed day, Ormazd
and all 300 of his offspring suddenly died in one night in the city of Gurabad. Following such an unthinkable event, the
throne naturally fell to Kisra, who added &quot;Ravan&quot; to his title and became the most powerful vassal king among mortals.</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>The fairy abruptly stopped her tale and looked up at the red sun that was now sinking behind the sand dunes. She then
whistled sharply, signaling to the youth to halt the Sumpter Beast and prepare to make camp for the night under the
crumbling stone pillars.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people say...&quot; The fairy lithely leaped down from the Sumpter Beast and circled across the sands in a manner not
unlike the long-lost dancers of Setaria, letting the moon's first light evenly coat her translucent skin in its silvery
sheen. The scent of myrrh swirled around her myriad braids as the golden bells rang out into the distance. Then, the
fairy leaned over slightly, balancing on the tips of her toes as she laughed softly.</p>
<p>Some people say that the tragedy that befell the city of Gurabad was the handiwork of the hero Kisra. Some people say
that the night the tragedy took place, an evil, clawless bird flew out from the redoubt and wailed throughout the night
without stopping to eat or drink. The castle was then struck by a plague of rats with human faces, which gnawed at the
gold chains from which the crown hung, causing the cumbersome thing to crash heavily to the ground, broken and bent.
People say that the crown made such an earth-shaking noise when it fell that even the Fellahin servants, who had settled
and toiled far from the redoubt, trembled with fear at this tyrant they had never met. Later still, it is said that an
adventurer found the ancient crypts of the city of Gurabad beneath the gilded sands, in which were hidden the withered,
massive remains of Ormazd and his offspring, An ancient, inscrutable inscription was left on each of the shriveled
bodies...</p>
<p>&quot;I hope this story frightened you.&quot; The fairy watched keenly as the mortal boy before her drank from the waterskin. The
tribes of the desert regard water with an instinctive restraint and prudence. Spirits, however, are born of pure
elemental energy and know neither thirst nor the satisfaction of the pleasure of luxury, just like the ancient princess
Shirin in this lament.</p>
<p>&quot;As for the daughter of the foremother Liloufar I mentioned, Shirin — why, our story has only just begun...&quot; The fairy
smiled slyly again, her eyes like an amalgam of amber and gold, her smiling face like the princess of her ancient
homeland.</p>
<h2 id="volume-2-20"><a class="header" href="#volume-2-20">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>At that time, the promised land of &quot;Valivija&quot; was engulfed by wild, gilded sands, and one of the three living gods had
fallen. Amidst a century of chaos and confusion, the scattered mortals ensconced themselves in vassal states until my
lord Al-Ahmar and the Sage-King of the Greenwood gathered their subjects. Once the oasis paradise was reconstructed, the
age of the vassal kings, the age of division, finally came to a close.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you've mentioned this part of the story already.&quot; The youth's tone was rather impatient as he gazed at the full
moon hanging in the starry sky, using the positions of its companion stars to determine the next day's route. But the
spirit knew that he was, in truth, listening earnestly to her story. She couldn't refrain from letting out a triumphant
snort, but was immediately annoyed by this unbecoming action: &quot;The mortal mind is as fickle as it is forgetful. How
should I know whether you were listening or not?&quot;</p>
<p>Back to the subject at hand — Shirin, according to the spirits' lamentations, was the daughter of the mortal hero Ormazd
and the fairy Liloufar, the Daughter of the Water Lily. Born upon a lily pad amid fragrant dewdrops, the white ibis
blessed her, and the cobra bequeathed to her a cerulean pearl, and even the mighty giant crocodile bowed to her in
worship. As the foremother of the spirits, before she delivered her daughter to the mortal vassal king, Liloufar
prophesied three times: First, that Shirin would fall in love with a great hero, and the progeny of their union would
surpass their father. Second, that many of Shirin's relatives would enjoy a sweet end, and third, that Shirin alone
would be given possession of her father's kingdom. Then, Liloufar gave three admonitions to her mortal darling: First,
that her joy would bring tears to her father's eyes. Second, that they should no longer feast at the same table as their
daughter after she was wed, and third, that their daughter's heir would be an ill omen upon the king's land.</p>
<p>The king, however, only smiled at these prophecies and admonitions.</p>
<p>&quot;Later, Shirin's father offered her hand in marriage to the great hero 'Parvezravan,' fulfilling the first prophecy,
right?&quot; The youth said, interrupting the spirit's story.</p>
<p>&quot;That's correct, though, not entirely so...&quot; The spirit laid a finger on the tip of the youth's nose and the latter
hurriedly moved away, his face flushed as if he feared she might put some ethereal, deathly curse on him. The spirit
once again found herself amused by such an innocent act.</p>
<p>By the time Shirin grew a little older and more cognizant, the vision her mother laid out for her became a lingering
curse. He spent her days awaiting her chance to fall in love with a hero, waiting for the day when she would inherit her
father's kingdom, and longing for that sweet and perfect future — but it never came.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Shirin's marriage to the hero Kisra was not a happy one — after all, mortal heroes are all warped people
harboring the ambition to rule. The daughter of Liloufar carried the pride of the spirits, and thus she found the golden
trap of the mortal hero's supposed affections hard to endure, and she found no peace between the bed and the hearth. And
so at last, a vivid hatred coalesced from this passionless, dull, rotten life — the same hatred that those imprisoned in
the silver bottle carry.</p>
<p>Later, on the night of the infamous grand banquet, a few lowly slaves — mages of the Mazandaran Oasis, or perhaps some
illiterate Fellahin servants — dripped scorpion venom into musk honey and offered it to the vassal king Ormazd and his
300 heirs. They then watched as they sunk into the sweet, dreamless landscape of death, drowning in the fat and blood of
the wretched as their blood and tears flowed freely... And on this night, all who remained with dreams left to enjoy
were Shirin, who had been excluded from the party by her own father, and her reluctant co-conspirator and husband,
Kisra. The lowly regicides were thereupon submerged in the honey pot as punishment by the new king, and they cursed him
with their last breaths as they choked on the sticky honey. And from the new king's mouth gushed blackened, dirtied, and
bloodied lies, which gradually stained his hero's reputation a deep black... And so, the second prophecy was fulfilled.</p>
<p>Later, Shiruyeh, the son of Kisra Parvezravan, grew to adulthood beloved by his mother, but was banished by his father
from the towering city of Gurabad. Made by his father to hide his face and flee on a fast steed, Shiruyeh was henceforth
forbidden from setting foot in the city again. Undoubtedly terrified of the fairy-mother Liloufar's warning, it was
Parvezravan's fixation that gave rise to the cowardice that spurred this decision. And so, Shirin once again found the
perfect opportunity for revenge in the vassal king's unfettered fear.</p>
<p>One night, she disguised herself as a divine princess of the temple to the moon goddess and met with her prodigal son
who had sojourned there. In the lingering silvery light that danced amidst the dew-dotted lilies, she gave the masked
wayfarer this false, illusory prophecy: &quot;Is the tyranny of the wanderer's father not his greatest misfortune? O darling
of the moon goddess, everywhere the moonlight touches is yours to rule, and every seed you sow shall grow and flourish.
Since the moonlight has granted you a good bow and a sharp blade, why do you suffer that coward idling upon the throne?
Why not muster up the courage to face your hatred, to face yourself?&quot; Legend has it that just as Shiruyeh hesitated in
indecision, a gust of wind rushed through the night and blew the veil Shirin had used to conceal her face away. Seeing
that familiar face, the young man who had been forced to cover his was instantly overcome with terror and shame. He fled
the sullied temple in a panic, and laughter soft as the ringing of a bell and the cruel moonlight bore witness to his
fear.</p>
<p>The story from here is a lackluster one: The peerless vassal king &quot;Parvezravan&quot; would be stabbed to death in his bed by
his own masked, unfilial son, and his magnificent bed — once adorned with sapphire and golden animal horns — would be
indelibly stained with his blood. The dirge of the spirits then goes like this: After committing this crime of treason,
Shiruyeh wept bitterly before his mother Shirin in repentance. But Shirin did not reprimand him. Rather she took her
beloved son into her arms, removed the brass mask symbolizing his exile, and left him with an affectionate kiss of
benediction.</p>
<p>After Shiruyeh claimed the throne, he was long tormented by inescapable nightmares until finally, on a frenzied night of
wandering, he fell into a deep black chasm in the earth and disappeared. Later, a great plague emerged from that chasm
and swallowed up half of the souls in the city of Gurabad. The kingdom, having lost its vassal king and his servants,
fell into ruin and was gradually devoured by that insatiable yellow sand. The scattered survivors of this calamity
called it &quot;Shiruyeh's Plague&quot; — the divine retribution invited by the absurdly short-lived despot himself.</p>
<p>As for his mother Shirin, Liloufar's third prophecy was indeed fulfilled — She and the heir she bore won true freedom in
a kingdom ravaged by vengeance, and they became evil apparitions, death knells to the conceited.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people say that Shirin was later subdued by my lord Al-Ahmar, who detained her in a magic silver bottle. Others
say that she still roams the desert, tormenting overconfident adventurers and tirelessly searching for the beloved child
that she lost to that dark world...&quot; The fairy smiled proudly, having theatrically concluded the story. At this time,
the moon was already high in the sky, and the distant, ancient time when the desert had not yet become a desert was
nigh. It was time for the divine princess to hold the sacrifice.</p>
