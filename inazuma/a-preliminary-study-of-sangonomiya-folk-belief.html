<p>The version of this tale most widely accepted by the people of both Narukami and Watatsumi Island reads as follows:
Around two thousand years ago, the Archon War was drawing to a close in Inazuma. It is said that during this time, the
Great Serpent Orobashi broke the coral branches off his body and guided the people of the deep sea back to the light of
day, and by his grace and pity, he gathered them together to make a living upon the barren island of coral. But in this
world of fickle fortune, humans, puny as they are, often suffered on account of their bitter lives and were gloomy
because of their pain and misfortune. The bright sun, the clear skies, and seas, the clam palace that glittered with
rainbow light, the teachings of the clergy... None of these could assuage the wounds of hunger and disease. The Great
Serpent never forgot his past as one of the defeated, or his oath to never again allow his people to be forsaken. So he
asked the shrine maiden: &quot;Blessed daughter of mine, why do the people of the deep sea weep? Have I not defeated the
Dragonheirs of the Depths and given you the light of day?&quot; The wise shrine maiden replied: &quot;Famine.&quot; The Great Serpent
asked again: &quot;Indeed, it is my failing that has caused you to go hungry. What then, my people, is your request?&quot; The
honest elders replied: &quot;You made a road for us, guiding us to create a nation amidst the blue seas with no need for
robbery, oppression, or tyranny. For this, we are already more than grateful... Yet, to the east of our coral island,
there are lands wider and more fertile still.&quot; &quot;Permit us, great lord, to set foot upon those islands and there carve
out a dominion for ourselves, that our children after us shall have a glorious past, a future in fullness, and a present
without darkness.&quot;</p>
<p>The Great Serpent was silent and made no reply. Narukami it was that dominated the eastern islands, possessing great
strength in war, and those deities defeated thus were all slain to the last, in accordance with the law of the divine
realm. But in the many years that followed, the hungry and diseased people would ask time and again, at last moving the
heart of their god. Thus did the Great Serpent train them to become mighty warriors who commandeered ships and sea
monsters while mastering wave and cloud, leading them in an invasion of the Electro Archon's lands amidst the whistling
of whalesongs... But the people of the sea knew not that Watatsumi Omikami had embarked upon a violent campaign in which
he had no hope of victory, and his purpose was not conquest, but sacrifice. It is said that there were inscriptions
which the shrine maiden hid, upon which were written a prophecy of the certain defeat and the future of humiliation that
awaited this eastern expedition.</p>
<p>Orobashi's true motives are not well-recorded by history. This is merely a hypothesis drawn by those who discovered the
inscriptions: Watatsumi Omikami long knew that he would not have any chance of survival this time, but accepted the
prophecy's result calmly. If he wished to ensure the perpetuation of his people's &quot;faith,&quot; there was but one path —
sacrifice. Even if Watatsumi would pass away, its people would endlessly weave their memories of joy, prosperity,
bitterness, and loss into a united faith. These memories, in turn, would flourish on account of the intense emotions of
a vanquished people forced into shameful submission.</p>
<p>Many among the Watatsumi people now no longer believe that their guiding Omikami has any chance of revival, but their
pride as Watatsumi's people, the pain of watching the body of their god carved up for minerals by their overlord, the
hurt of losing that god... These emotions have passed on from generation to generation, becoming the pillars of
forbearance, resistance, and sacrifice that underpin the faith of Watatsumi's people.</p>
<p>As the author has mentioned, Sangonomiya has an extreme lack of written historical material. As such, these past motives
have all essentially become fictional tales upon which future generations can inscribe any meaning they wish. Thus,
these histories have become &quot;histories of accumulated consciousness&quot; rather than &quot;histories of recorded fact.&quot; The fact
that this collective consciousness has been strengthened and rendered ever more cohesive over time, such that a people
who have lost their beloved god may still actively resist a nation whose faith is in a mighty elemental deity... This
just goes to show that their persistence is hardly some obsolete thing.</p>
<p>Notably, this tendency to give little thought to the &quot;facts&quot; of the past and emphasize the &quot;consciousness&quot; of the
present is a glaring flaw in Watatsumi today. The flames of these hatreds and humiliations, borne and nursed over
hundreds and thousands of years, can be fanned by those with an agenda in leaner years and ultimately bring catastrophe
upon the nation.</p>
<p>But though I say this, while the people of Watatsumi are known for their forbearance, are they really to grin and bear
this mortification endlessly for the sake of survival? With their recent economic exploitation at the hands of the
Kanjou Commission, more and more of the young people of Watatsumi Island are discussing resistance and their complaints.
It seems evident to me that these discussions are not merely about the past, but about the present and future also.</p>
<p>However, there is another version of the legend of Watatsumi Omikami's slaying: While the people of the deep yet dwelt
in the depths, they kept very reliable chronicles, for there was no day or night for them. If they kept no precise
records, they would even forget what time it was. But these chronicles were ordered sealed in Enkanomiya by the Great
Serpent, never to be retrieved. The names of the people of Watatsumi were also not written in the Inazuman style then.
The names and surnames used today by them came about by order of the Great Serpent, who had them learn the traditions of
Narukami. It is said that when Watatsumi Omikami decided to bring the people of the depths out of the waters, he did
this at the instruction of the heavens themselves. For Watatsumi Omikami had once fled into the Dark Sea to avoid the
Archon War, committing a grave sin in the process. Thus perhaps it was upon heaven's order that Orobashi went to his
death — though this cannot be known for sure. Unfortunately, the script once used in Enkanomiya is known to few, and the
books themselves have been hidden there also. Thus, I fear that the truth of the matter shall never see the light of
day. However, these legends that hint at the &quot;truth&quot; are but unimportant anecdotes compared to the aforementioned ones
that imply much about the &quot;consciousness&quot; of the people.</p>
