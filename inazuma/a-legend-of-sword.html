<p>&quot;Even if Emperor Sher's ambitions are realized, how will anybody benefit from it?&quot;</p>
<p>Secretary of Defense Faranges stared out of the window into space as the galaxies and stars shone gently upon her face,
their pale white glow flowing softly and slowly down each strand of her hair.</p>
<p>She couldn't help but think back to the first time she looked out at this ocean of stars through this very window. But
she no longer remembered the sense of awe she felt back then. Even her homeland, now hundreds of light-years away, had
long since become faded and distorted in her memories whenever they surfaced in her dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;Forgive me for speaking out of place, Your Highness, but this war has been dragging on for far too long. We've battled
through countless constellations, wiped out tens of millions of lives in all sorts of devious ways, and made ourselves
viceroys and envoys of every obscure constellation we came across, all in an effort to make Emperor Sher's dreams a
reality. But what has His grand vision brought us? One misfortune after another, and an ever-growing number of enemies.
They're in every corner of the galaxy now... it's just a matter of time before they swallow us up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My brother's vision is for an empire that will rule for all eternity, one where there is no fear, and where people do
not lack for anything. The fate of the many will no longer be dictated by the few, no one will enjoy a higher status
than anybody else, and even incompetence will no longer be seen as a crime. And so... it is inevitable that those who
cannot comprehend this grand vision are doomed to be swept aside. This is their fate.&quot;</p>
<p>Princess Gopatha shook her head and spoke with a gentle yet cold tone.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the Intergalactic Anti-Guerrilla War had robbed her of more than just one of her eyes and one of her
arms, because when Faranges looked at her, she did not see the joyful young woman she once knew.</p>
<p>&quot;I trust in brother's decision — he would not act out of mere self-interest. So please, even though it is you, don't say
such things again in the future. Don't speak words that sow doubt.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="volume-2"><a class="header" href="#volume-2">Volume 2</a></h2>
<p>Surely, even an armada consisting entirely of Eizida-class warships would have a tough job making a dent in a defense as
watertight as this one.</p>
<p>Admiral Geldafried's overconfidence in the greatest technological marvel of the empire meant that she was completely
unaware that the rebels were, at that very moment, closing in on the fatal weakness of their base. The mighty Star
Fortress, Anusharwan — designed personally by Princess Geppeta, and named by Emperor Sher — was now nothing more than a
fragile egg before the rebel fleet, and mother hen was away from the nest.</p>
<p>Bastinu deftly navigated the Lachsz Clipper through the intricate and winding ventilation system, weaving between jets
of poisonous gas and elemental clouds shooting out from holes in the walls, while trying to shake the automatic
mechanical sentries on his tail. His eyes and ears filled with blood and the scene before him merged into a continuous
blur of color and light as the clipper shot ahead at a breathtaking speed. &quot;Now's my chance.&quot; So thought Bastinu to
himself as the propulsion system's energy core came gradually into view. &quot;It's time.&quot; So thought Admiral Geldafried to
herself as she gazed at the flashing sphere of light in the planet's orbit. Then, she gave the order to launch an
indiscriminate assault on the planet. Then, Bastinu launched a fatal attack on the fortress core.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, what I would give to see the look on Princess Geppeta's face right now...&quot; So thought both to themselves,
separately but identically, in that brief moment.</p>
<h2 id="volume-3"><a class="header" href="#volume-3">Volume 3</a></h2>
<p>Ten years earlier... 25 light years away...</p>
<p>With the nation under the rule of the Suruga Shogunate, cries of anguish filled the streets as the people suffered
bitterly. At that time, the Suruga Shogunate was led by the Seii Tai-Shogun, Imagawa Ujizane. Four years prior, after
finally beheading Demon King Danjouchuu, the Tai-Shogun's own reign of terror began. It was in this time and place that
our free and unrestrained swordmaster wandered the land. His name was Bitchuu Kyuubei, and he was known to the people as
Shinkurou, the vigilante. Bitchuu Kyuubei was not a ronin as such. It is said that he was once the most trusted
strategist for His Excellency the Tai-Shogun, until one day he was framed by a rival. Given the Shogun's paranoid
nature, this left him with no choice but to flee the Shogunate and escape into the wilderness.</p>
<p>Today, Shinkurou was standing on a mountainside gazing into the distance. But what was the object of his gaze? Was it
the vast expanse of open fields? No. Was it the mountain range in the distance? No. Was it the road stretching out ahead
of him? Yes! Although, that's not the full story.</p>
<p>So. What was the object of Shinkurou's gaze, exactly...? The farmers who had paid the swordsman in rice for his services
cowered in fear, too afraid to ask.</p>
<p>It seems that only the silent swordsman himself knew the answer to this question.</p>
<h2 id="volume-4"><a class="header" href="#volume-4">Volume 4</a></h2>
<p>&quot;The fall is here. The season of harvest is almost upon us.&quot; The one speaking was Saitou Onisa.</p>
<p>Ninjas are dangerous individuals, experts in self-preservation and in avoiding danger. In times of war and upheaval,
they work as mercenaries for the Daimyo. They are born in war, and they draw their strength from the powerful masters
they work for. Such is the path of the ninja. But it is also the path of the ninja to become displaced and disillusioned
at the end of a war, or to meet their ruin as soon as they lose their powerful backing.</p>
<p>So when the Imagawa Tai-Shogun finally united the country, the ninjas became like hunting dogs that had outlived their
purpose. Most were either executed or drafted into the shogun's army, but some got away, disappeared into the
wilderness, and turned to a life of banditry. That is precisely Saitou Onisa's story.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no rush. Let's wait for the villagers to finish harvesting the grain for us.&quot; The person speaking this time was
called Yonemata Tasuke.</p>
<p>Bandits are either samurai who have grown weary of the warrior's way or farmers fighting to stay alive. They, too, are
born in war. They draw their strength from cunning, and this emboldens them to run amok across across the land. But when
war ends and peace is restored, the source of their power evaporates. Like mayflies, they disappear as quickly as they
came.</p>
<p>Yonemata Tasuke was born into an ordinary farming family, only turning to banditry in his forties. Yet, despite his age,
he took to it with great aplomb, and quickly established himself as a ringleader. The most terrible of all bandits are
those who have themselves suffered terribly under an oppressive hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, we burn everything. Leave no survivors.&quot;</p>
<p>His was the voice of an age of upheaval.</p>
<h2 id="volume-5"><a class="header" href="#volume-5">Volume 5</a></h2>
<p>The terrain of Asada Village was shaped like crescent moon.</p>
<p>Shinkurou had noticed this the very first time he set foot in the marshland.</p>
<p>If he could organize enough villagers to lie in ambush up on the mountain ridge, shielding themselves with the terrain
and attacking downwards from the high ground, defeating the enemy would be easy. Especially since the bandits would be
weary from their journey. Furthermore, the villagers outnumbered the bandits, so surrounding them on all sides would not
be difficult to pull off.</p>
<p>But the biggest obstacle to this plan was the villagers themselves. A small group of easy targets would be needed as
bait to lure the bandits into the valley, but after enduring an age of despotic rule, only to continue to suffer under
the tyrannical and extortionate taxation practices of the present Shogunate, the mentality of individual
self-preservation was deeply ingrained. How was he going to convince anybody to volunteer to be the bait and sacrifice
themselves for everyone else's benefit?</p>
<p>There was one other problem, too. In wartime, a samurai army finding themselves in this situation would be certain to
use fire to make their ambush more effective. The wind from the mountain would make the fire spread quickly, trapping
the enemy in the valley and dealing them a devastating blow.</p>
<p>But this was farming community seeking to keep their land and village safe. There was nothing he could say to convince
them that setting their houses and grain reserves on fire was anything close a good idea. This was completely
understandable, of course, but the fact was that an even worse fate would await them they fail to take the bandits down.</p>
<p>Shinkurou silently sat down and continued to ponder the conundrum.</p>
